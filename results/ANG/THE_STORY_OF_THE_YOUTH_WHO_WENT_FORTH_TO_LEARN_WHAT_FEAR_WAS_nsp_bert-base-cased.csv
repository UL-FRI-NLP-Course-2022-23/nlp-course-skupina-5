and could do everything, but the younger was stupid and could neither
learn nor understand anything, and when people saw him they said:

had to be done, it was always the elder who was forced to do it; but
if his father bade him fetch anything when it was late, or in the
night-time, and the way led through the churchyard, or any other dismal
place, he answered: ‘Oh, no father, I’ll not go there, it makes me
shudder!’ for he was afraid.",2.063783645629883,1.7135884761810303,-0.35019516944885254,1

up, unbound one of them after the other, and brought down all seven.",0.18017402291297913,0.11416440457105637,-0.06600961834192276,1

these should never see the daylight again.’
