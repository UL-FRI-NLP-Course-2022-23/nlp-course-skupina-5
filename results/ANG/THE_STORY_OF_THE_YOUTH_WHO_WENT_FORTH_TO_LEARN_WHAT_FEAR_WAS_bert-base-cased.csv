and could do everything, but the younger was stupid and could neither
learn nor understand anything, and when people saw him they said:
‘There’s a fellow who will give his father some trouble!’ When anything
had to be done, it was always the elder who was forced to do it; but
if his father bade him fetch anything when it was late, or in the
night-time, and the way led through the churchyard, or any other dismal
place, he answered: ‘Oh, no father, I’ll not go there, it makes me
shudder!’ for he was afraid.",18.71791939113451,20.612814198369566,1.8948948072350547,1

up, unbound one of them after the other, and brought down all seven.",16.78324607566551,18.52359347873264,1.7403474030671298,1

The youth likewise went his way, and once more began to mutter to
himself: ‘Ah, if I could but shudder!",17.433881111692585,20.323249196321772,2.8893680846291865,1

whence do you come?’ ‘I know not.’ ‘Who is your father?’ ‘That I may
not tell you.’ ‘What is it that you are always muttering between your
teeth?’ ‘Ah,’ replied the youth, ‘I do so wish I could shudder, but
no one can teach me how.’ ‘Enough of your foolish chatter,’ said the
waggoner.",16.53823792700674,19.48660098805147,2.9483630610447307,1

but shudder!’ The host who heard this, laughed and said: ‘If that is
your desire, there ought to be a good opportunity for you here.’ ‘Ah,
be silent,’ said the hostess, ‘so many prying persons have already lost
their lives, it would be a pity and a shame if such beautiful eyes as
these should never see the daylight again.’

But the youth said: ‘However difficult it may be, I will learn it.",16.422122730928308,18.86016007965686,2.438037348728553,1

this purpose indeed have I journeyed forth.’ He let the host have
no rest, until the latter told him, that not far from thence stood a
haunted castle where anyone could very easily learn what shuddering was,
if he would but watch in it for three nights.",15.228483216952434,16.33305642457135,1.104573207618916,1

youth went next morning to the king, and said: ‘If it be allowed, I will
willingly watch three nights in the haunted castle.’

ask for three things to take into the castle with you, but they must
be things without life.’ Then he answered: ‘Then I ask for a fire, a
turning lathe, and a cutting-board with the knife.’

The king had these things carried into the castle for him during the
day.",17.428124013573232,20.96954407354798,3.5414200599747474,1
