and could do everything, but the younger was stupid and could neither
learn nor understand anything, and when people saw him they said:
‘There’s a fellow who will give his father some trouble!’ When anything
had to be done, it was always the elder who was forced to do it; but
if his father bade him fetch anything when it was late, or in the
night-time, and the way led through the churchyard, or any other dismal
place, he answered: ‘Oh, no father, I’ll not go there, it makes me
shudder!’ for he was afraid.",3.8024888166013358,4.478123752359175,0.6756349357578393,1

up, unbound one of them after the other, and brought down all seven.",3.257642594854122,3.9188611441046572,0.6612185492505351,1

your desire, there ought to be a good opportunity for you here.’ ‘Ah,

their lives, it would be a pity and a shame if such beautiful eyes as
these should never see the daylight again.’
