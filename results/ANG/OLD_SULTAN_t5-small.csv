were standing together before the house the shepherd said, ‘I will shoot
old Sultan tomorrow morning, for he is of no use now.’ But his wife
said, ‘Pray let the poor faithful creature live; he has served us well a
great many years, and we ought to give him a livelihood for the rest of

tomorrow shall be his last day, depend upon it.’

and his wife said to one another, and was very much frightened to think

friend the wolf, who lived in the wood, and told him all his sorrows,
and how his master meant to kill him in the morning.",14.72260810959507,13.958645099765258,-0.763963009829812,1

down close by the child, and pretend to be watching it, and I will come

you can, and I will let it drop; then you may carry it back, and they
will think you have saved their child, and will be so thankful to you
