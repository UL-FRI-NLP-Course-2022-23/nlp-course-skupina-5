0,THE GOLDEN BIRD,"A certain king had a beautiful garden, and in the garden stood a tree
which bore golden apples. These apples were always counted, and about
the time when they began to grow ripe it was found that every night one
of them was gone. The king became very angry at this, and ordered the
gardener to keep watch all night under the tree. The gardener set his
eldest son to watch; but about twelve o’clock he fell asleep, and in
the morning another of the apples was missing. Then the second son was
ordered to watch; and at midnight he too fell asleep, and in the morning
another apple was gone. Then the third son offered to keep watch; but
the gardener at first would not let him, for fear some harm should come
to him: however, at last he consented, and the young man laid himself
under the tree to watch. As the clock struck twelve he heard a rustling
noise in the air, and a bird came flying that was of pure gold; and as
it was snapping at one of the apples with its beak, the gardener’s son
jumped up and shot an arrow at it. But the arrow did the bird no harm;
only it dropped a golden feather from its tail, and then flew away.
The golden feather was brought to the king in the morning, and all the
council was called together. Everyone agreed that it was worth more than
all the wealth of the kingdom: but the king said, ‘One feather is of no
use to me, I must have the whole bird.’

Then the gardener’s eldest son set out and thought to find the golden
bird very easily; and when he had gone but a little way, he came to a
wood, and by the side of the wood he saw a fox sitting; so he took his
bow and made ready to shoot at it. Then the fox said, ‘Do not shoot me,
for I will give you good counsel; I know what your business is, and
that you want to find the golden bird. You will reach a village in the
evening; and when you get there, you will see two inns opposite to each
other, one of which is very pleasant and beautiful to look at: go not in
there, but rest for the night in the other, though it may appear to you
to be very poor and mean.’ But the son thought to himself, ‘What can
such a beast as this know about the matter?’ So he shot his arrow at
the fox; but he missed it, and it set up its tail above its back and
ran into the wood. Then he went his way, and in the evening came to
the village where the two inns were; and in one of these were people
singing, and dancing, and feasting; but the other looked very dirty,
and poor. ‘I should be very silly,’ said he, ‘if I went to that shabby
house, and left this charming place’; so he went into the smart house,
and ate and drank at his ease, and forgot the bird, and his country too.

Time passed on; and as the eldest son did not come back, and no tidings
were heard of him, the second son set out, and the same thing happened
to him. He met the fox, who gave him the good advice: but when he came
to the two inns, his eldest brother was standing at the window where
the merrymaking was, and called to him to come in; and he could not
withstand the temptation, but went in, and forgot the golden bird and
his country in the same manner.

Time passed on again, and the youngest son too wished to set out into
the wide world to seek for the golden bird; but his father would not
listen to it for a long while, for he was very fond of his son, and
was afraid that some ill luck might happen to him also, and prevent his
coming back. However, at last it was agreed he should go, for he would
not rest at home; and as he came to the wood, he met the fox, and heard
the same good counsel. But he was thankful to the fox, and did not
attempt his life as his brothers had done; so the fox said, ‘Sit upon my
tail, and you will travel faster.’ So he sat down, and the fox began to
run, and away they went over stock and stone so quick that their hair
whistled in the wind.

When they came to the village, the son followed the fox’s counsel, and
without looking about him went to the shabby inn and rested there all
night at his ease. In the morning came the fox again and met him as he
was beginning his journey, and said, ‘Go straight forward, till you come
to a castle, before which lie a whole troop of soldiers fast asleep and
snoring: take no notice of them, but go into the castle and pass on and
on till you come to a room, where the golden bird sits in a wooden cage;
close by it stands a beautiful golden cage; but do not try to take the
bird out of the shabby cage and put it into the handsome one, otherwise
you will repent it.’ Then the fox stretched out his tail again, and the
young man sat himself down, and away they went over stock and stone till
their hair whistled in the wind.

Before the castle gate all was as the fox had said: so the son went in
and found the chamber where the golden bird hung in a wooden cage, and
below stood the golden cage, and the three golden apples that had been
lost were lying close by it. Then thought he to himself, ‘It will be a
very droll thing to bring away such a fine bird in this shabby cage’; so
he opened the door and took hold of it and put it into the golden cage.
But the bird set up such a loud scream that all the soldiers awoke, and
they took him prisoner and carried him before the king. The next morning
the court sat to judge him; and when all was heard, it sentenced him to
die, unless he should bring the king the golden horse which could run as
swiftly as the wind; and if he did this, he was to have the golden bird
given him for his own.

So he set out once more on his journey, sighing, and in great despair,
when on a sudden his friend the fox met him, and said, ‘You see now
what has happened on account of your not listening to my counsel. I will
still, however, tell you how to find the golden horse, if you will do as
I bid you. You must go straight on till you come to the castle where the
horse stands in his stall: by his side will lie the groom fast asleep
and snoring: take away the horse quietly, but be sure to put the old
leathern saddle upon him, and not the golden one that is close by it.’
Then the son sat down on the fox’s tail, and away they went over stock
and stone till their hair whistled in the wind.

All went right, and the groom lay snoring with his hand upon the golden
saddle. But when the son looked at the horse, he thought it a great pity
to put the leathern saddle upon it. ‘I will give him the good one,’
said he; ‘I am sure he deserves it.’ As he took up the golden saddle the
groom awoke and cried out so loud, that all the guards ran in and took
him prisoner, and in the morning he was again brought before the court
to be judged, and was sentenced to die. But it was agreed, that, if he
could bring thither the beautiful princess, he should live, and have the
bird and the horse given him for his own.

Then he went his way very sorrowful; but the old fox came and said, ‘Why
did not you listen to me? If you had, you would have carried away
both the bird and the horse; yet will I once more give you counsel. Go
straight on, and in the evening you will arrive at a castle. At twelve
o’clock at night the princess goes to the bathing-house: go up to her
and give her a kiss, and she will let you lead her away; but take care
you do not suffer her to go and take leave of her father and mother.’
Then the fox stretched out his tail, and so away they went over stock
and stone till their hair whistled again.

As they came to the castle, all was as the fox had said, and at twelve
o’clock the young man met the princess going to the bath and gave her the
kiss, and she agreed to run away with him, but begged with many tears
that he would let her take leave of her father. At first he refused,
but she wept still more and more, and fell at his feet, till at last
he consented; but the moment she came to her father’s house the guards
awoke and he was taken prisoner again.

Then he was brought before the king, and the king said, ‘You shall never
have my daughter unless in eight days you dig away the hill that stops
the view from my window.’ Now this hill was so big that the whole world
could not take it away: and when he had worked for seven days, and had
done very little, the fox came and said. ‘Lie down and go to sleep; I
will work for you.’ And in the morning he awoke and the hill was gone;
so he went merrily to the king, and told him that now that it was
removed he must give him the princess.

Then the king was obliged to keep his word, and away went the young man
and the princess; and the fox came and said to him, ‘We will have all
three, the princess, the horse, and the bird.’ ‘Ah!’ said the young man,
‘that would be a great thing, but how can you contrive it?’

‘If you will only listen,’ said the fox, ‘it can be done. When you come
to the king, and he asks for the beautiful princess, you must say, “Here
she is!” Then he will be very joyful; and you will mount the golden
horse that they are to give you, and put out your hand to take leave of
them; but shake hands with the princess last. Then lift her quickly on
to the horse behind you; clap your spurs to his side, and gallop away as
fast as you can.’

All went right: then the fox said, ‘When you come to the castle where
the bird is, I will stay with the princess at the door, and you will
ride in and speak to the king; and when he sees that it is the right
horse, he will bring out the bird; but you must sit still, and say that
you want to look at it, to see whether it is the true golden bird; and
when you get it into your hand, ride away.’

This, too, happened as the fox said; they carried off the bird, the
princess mounted again, and they rode on to a great wood. Then the fox
came, and said, ‘Pray kill me, and cut off my head and my feet.’ But the
young man refused to do it: so the fox said, ‘I will at any rate give
you good counsel: beware of two things; ransom no one from the gallows,
and sit down by the side of no river.’ Then away he went. ‘Well,’
thought the young man, ‘it is no hard matter to keep that advice.’

He rode on with the princess, till at last he came to the village where
he had left his two brothers. And there he heard a great noise and
uproar; and when he asked what was the matter, the people said, ‘Two men
are going to be hanged.’ As he came nearer, he saw that the two men were
his brothers, who had turned robbers; so he said, ‘Cannot they in any
way be saved?’ But the people said ‘No,’ unless he would bestow all his
money upon the rascals and buy their liberty. Then he did not stay to
think about the matter, but paid what was asked, and his brothers were
given up, and went on with him towards their home.

And as they came to the wood where the fox first met them, it was so
cool and pleasant that the two brothers said, ‘Let us sit down by the
side of the river, and rest a while, to eat and drink.’ So he said,
‘Yes,’ and forgot the fox’s counsel, and sat down on the side of the
river; and while he suspected nothing, they came behind, and threw him
down the bank, and took the princess, the horse, and the bird, and went
home to the king their master, and said. ‘All this have we won by our
labour.’ Then there was great rejoicing made; but the horse would not
eat, the bird would not sing, and the princess wept.

The youngest son fell to the bottom of the river’s bed: luckily it was
nearly dry, but his bones were almost broken, and the bank was so steep
that he could find no way to get out. Then the old fox came once more,
and scolded him for not following his advice; otherwise no evil would
have befallen him: ‘Yet,’ said he, ‘I cannot leave you here, so lay hold
of my tail and hold fast.’ Then he pulled him out of the river, and said
to him, as he got upon the bank, ‘Your brothers have set watch to kill
you, if they find you in the kingdom.’ So he dressed himself as a poor
man, and came secretly to the king’s court, and was scarcely within the
doors when the horse began to eat, and the bird to sing, and the princess
left off weeping. Then he went to the king, and told him all his
brothers’ roguery; and they were seized and punished, and he had the
princess given to him again; and after the king’s death he was heir to
his kingdom.

A long while after, he went to walk one day in the wood, and the old fox
met him, and besought him with tears in his eyes to kill him, and cut
off his head and feet. And at last he did so, and in a moment the
fox was changed into a man, and turned out to be the brother of the
princess, who had been lost a great many many years.",2540,zlata ptica,"Kralj je imel na svojem vrtu neizrečeno lepo jablano, ki je rodila zlata jabolka, a jih nikoli niso mogli dobiti. Vsako jutro je eno manjkalo. Noč in dan je postavljal k drevesu straže, da bi zasačil tatu, toda tudi najboljši stražniki niso mogli dobiti nikogar, ki bi hodil po jabolka, pa je vendar manjkalo slednje jutro po eno. Vse to ni nič pomagalo in vojaki so se že branili hoditi na stražo.

Kralj pa je imel tri sinove. Starejša dva sta bila bolj poredna in mlajšega brata nista nič kaj marala. Kralj je rekel, naj stražijo tudi sinovi in prvo noč je šel najstarejši. Vzel je puško, jo dobro napolnil, hodil gor in dol in gledal okoli sebe, kdaj in od kod bo kdo prišel. Vso noč ni bilo nikogar, toda drugo jutro je jabolko le manjkalo. Drugo noč gre srednji sin. Z nabito puško hodi gor in dol kakor prvi in gleda okoli sebe, kdaj in od kod bo kdo prišel nad jablano, pa nikogar ni bilo, a jabolko je le manjkalo. Tretjo noč gre najmlajši. Namesto s svinčenim zrnjem nabije puško z grahom, češ da tatu ne bo ustrelil, temveč ga samo spoznal, kakšen tiček je to, ki zna tako krasti, da ga nihče ne zasači. Zvečer se ustopi pod drevo, upre oči v jabolka in gleda venomer vanja, ne da bi se ozrl kamor koli. Kar prileti okoli polnoči izpod neba ptič tako tiho, da se ni nič slišalo, in se spusti na drevo. S kremplji prime jabolko, najmlajši pa pomeri, sproži in mu odstreli tri peresa. Ptič se ustraši, pusti jabolko in zleti. Sin pobere peresa in vidi, da so iz čistega zlata. Ko brata slišita strel, brž vstaneta, pritečeta k

mlajšemu in ga vprašata, od kod je prišel tat. On pa jima reče: »Gledala bi, pa bi ga videla.«

Nato odide k očetu in mu pokaže tista tri peresa. Ker so bila peresa zlata, je rekel kralj sam pri sebi: — Kako lep mora biti šele ptič, ki ima taka peresa! — Ker bi ga rad imel, pravi naglas: »Kdor mi ga prinese, bo kralj.«

Starejšega je kraljestvo zelo mikalo; vzel je brašno in puško in šel iskat ptiča. Šel je v gozd, kajti v gozdu so ptice najrajši, češ tam jo bo že kje dobil. Hodil in hodil je po gozdovih in se oziral po drevesih, da bi zagledal ptico, ali zlate ptice ni bilo na nobenem. Pride do trate, in ker je bil lačen, stopi raz konja, sede na tla, vzame brašno iz torbe in začne jesti. Tedaj pa pride k njemu medved in ga prosi, naj da tudi njemu kaj jesti, rekoč: »Daj še meni malo, ker sem lačen.«

Starejši pogleda, zarezi nad medvedom in pravi: »Saj bo komaj zame dosti, pa bom še tebi dajal! Poberi se od mene; zate in za take, kot si ti, so v gozdu zverine. Pojdi in lovi jih!«

Medved se obrne in pravi: »Le počakaj, še slabo se ti bo godilo!« Zarenči in odide.

Ko se kraljevič naje, gre dalje in pade roparjem v roke. Vse mu vzamejo, kar je imel: denar in konja, in mu zažugajo, da ga celo umore, ko jih je prosil, naj ga spuste, ker je kraljevi sin. Ko pa jih je le za božjo voljo prosil, naj mu vsaj življenje puste, so roparji rekli, da drugače ne, le če se jim pridruži in hodi z njimi ropat. Kaj je hotel? Še bog, da ga niso umorili. Šel je z njimi in postal — ropar.

Leto je preteklo, toda starejšega sina še ni bilo domov. Zato reče srednji sin očetu, da namerava zdaj on iti iskat zlatega ptiča. Oče ga pusti, ker je obljubil, da se ob letu vrne domov, naj dobi ptiča ali ne. Oče mu da konja, puško, denarja in brašno. Srednji sin se napravi, zajaše konja in jezdi po isti poti, po kateri je

šel starejši brat. V gozdu gleda po drevesih po zlatem ptiču, toda zaman. Pride do iste trate, in ker je bil lačen, se ustavi, stopi raz konja, vzame brašno iz torbe in začne jesti. Spet pride medved in ga prosi, naj mu da kaj jesti, ker je lačen. Tudi ta ga zapodi kot prvi in pravi: »Poberi se od mene! Zate in za take, kot si ti, so v gozdu zverine. Pojdi in lovi jih!«

Medved se obrne in pravi: »Le počakaj, še slabo se ti bo godilo!« Zarenči in gre.

Ko se srednji brat naje, gre dalje in roparji ga dobe. Vzamejo mu vse, kar je imel: denar in konja, in mu zažugajo, da ga celo umore, kajti starejši brat gaje spoznal in se zbal, da bi očetu ne povedal, kaj je on. Ker pa le prosi in prosi, mu prizanesejo, seveda, če se jim pridruži in dela to, kar oni. Kaj hoče? Še bog, da ga niso umorili. Šel je z njimi in postal — ropar.

Leto je preteklo in tudi srednjega sina ni hotelo biti nazaj. Zdaj reče očetu še mlajši sin, da hoče iti tudi on iskat zlatega ptiča. Oče mu pa pravi: »Dva sta že šla in ju ni nazaj. Iti hočeš še ti, da tudi tebe ne bo. Ostani doma, vidiš, edino tebe še imam, ali naj še tebe izgubim?«

Toda sin ni dal miru. Tako dolgo je naganjal očeta, da ga je pustil, mu dal konja, denarja in brašno.

Najmlajši sin je jezdil po ravno isti poti in prišel na isto trato, kjer sta bila prejšnje in poprejšnje leto njegova brata. Stopi raz konja, vzame brašno iz torbe in začne jesti. Spet pride medved in ga prosi: »Daj še meni malo, saj vidiš, da sem lačen.«

Ta pa — dobrega srca, kakor je bil — reče: »O, le tukaj z menoj jej, kolikor hočeš in kolikor se ti poljubi. Bo že kako šlo, če zmanjka.« In medved je jedel in jedel, da je njemu le malo ostalo. Nato seže še v torbo in jo popolnoma izprazni. Toda medved spet je, da je bil kraljevič prav malo deležen. Medved

pa še ni bil sit. Pravi mu: »Daj mi še konja, da ga snem in se najem, ker sem lačen.«

»I,« pravi on, »saj ti bi ga dal, pa nimam potem na kom jezditi.«

Medved odgovori: »Boš pa mene jezdil.«

Kraljevič pravi: »Kako bom tebe jezdil, ko se mi bo vsak smejal, kdor me bo videl.«

Medved pa mu spet odvrne: »Naravnost tja te bom prinesel, kjer je tista stvar, ki jo iščeš.«

Ko kraljevič to sliši, si misli: — Če ti veš, kaj iščem, tudi veš, kje je! — in reče: »I — no, pa ga snej, da se naješ in lakoto zamoriš.«

Tedaj plane medved nad konja, ga razmesari in se naje. Ko se je nasitil, mu reče: »Zdaj pa ureži leskovo šibo, ki je v enem letu zrasla, zajaši me in prinesel te bom do zlatih ptičev.«

Mladenič je urezal leskovo šibo, kar je je v enem letu zraslo, zajahal medveda in dirjala sta, da sta pridirjala do skale. Pri skali se medved ustavi in pravi: »Tu, v tej skali je cela jata zlatih ptičev v zlatih kletkah. Mahni z leskovko po skali. Odprla se bo, pojdi vanjo in vzemi prvega ptiča, ki ti pride v roke, toda nikar ne izbiraj, da se ne zbude stražniki in te ne ujamejo.«

Stopil je z medveda, mahnil z leskovko po skali in skala se je odprla. Stopi v lep, prostoren kraj; na obeh straneh so visele zlate kletke z zlatimi ptiči, prvi lepši od drugega. Šel je od ptiča do ptiča in vsak mu je bil bolj všeč, dokler ni prišel do konca votline, kjer je bil najlepši ptič. Tega vzame in se obrne. Toda preden pride do drugega konca, se straže zbude, ga primejo in mu hudo žugajo. Vprašajo ga tudi, zakaj je hotel ptiča ukrasti. Mladenič pa se še nikoli ni zlagal in pove vse od konca do kraja. Stražniki so mu obljubili, da ga izpuste in mu podare zlatega ptiča, če jim pripelje takega in takega konja, ki mu ni v devetih deželah enakega.

Ko pride iz votline do medveda, mu reče medved: »Vidiš, zakaj me nisi poslušal in vzel takoj prvo ptico, do katere si prišel? Jaz sicer vem za takega konja, toda moraš me ubogati in storiti, kakor ti bom rekel. Vzemi leskovko, sedi spet name in si misli, da bi bil rad tam, kjer so tisti konji, ki jih v devetih deželah ni takih.«

Mladenič je vzel leskovko, sedel na medveda in si mislil: »O, da bi bil tam, kjer so tisti konji!« Komaj je to mislil, je že bil pred skalo.

Medved mu reče: »Udari spet s šibo po skali in skala se bo odprla. Dobil boš konjev celo čredo. Odvezi prvega, ki prideš do njega, in nikar ne izbiraj, da se stražniki ne zbude in te ne ujamejo.«

Mladenič stopi z medveda, udari s šibo po skali, ki se odpre in razmakne v votlino. Na obeh straneh so stali privezani konji, lepi, da bi jih kar gledal, prvi lepši od drugega, zadnji na koncu jame pa najlepši. Tega mladenič odveze in odpelje iz jame, toda od ropota kopit se stražniki zbude, ga primejo in mu hudo žugajo. Vprašajo ga tudi, zakaj je hotel konja ukrasti. Po pravici jim pove vse od kraja do konca in obljubili so mu, da ga izpuste in mu dajo konja, če jim pripelje morsko deklico. Mladenič jim obljubi in odide iz jame.

Ko pride do medveda, ga medved ošteje kot prvič, rekoč: »Saj sem ti rekel, zakaj me nisi poslušal? Pač vem, kje in kako bi se dala dobiti morska deklica. Tu spodaj ni daleč morje. Pojdi v mesto in si nakupi vsakovrstnega kramarskega blaga, z njim pojdi na breg morja in ga tam prodajaj. Prišle bodo tri morske deklice. Kupčuj samo s tisto, ki ti bo najbolj všeč. Ko bo nakupila in hotela oditi, naj ti da roko, da bo sreča večja. Takrat si pa misli, da bi bil rad pri konjih. Ročno boš tam, kjer si želiš. Tako delaj ves čas.« To medved reče in gre svojo pot.

Mladenič gre in gre in pride do mesta. Tu nakupi vsake vrste kramarskega blaga: trakov, šivank in drugih podobnih reči. S tem blagom gre k morju in ga tam razloži naprodaj. Pridejo tri morske deklice, prva lepša od druge. Samo s tisto, ki se mu je zdela najlepša, je kupčeval. Ko je deklica nakupila, kar je želela, ji mladenič reče, naj mu seže v roko, da bo sreča večja. Deklica mu seže v roko, on pa si misli: — Ko bi bil zdaj pri konjih! —

Kakor bi trenil z očmi, je bil mladenič z morsko deklico pri konjih. Tam so mu dali prej obljubljenega konja in vsi zamaknjeni so gledali morsko deklico, pa se je niso mogli nagledati. Mladenič sede na konja in preden gre, jih prosi, da bi še smel deklici seči v roko za slovo. Radi so mu dovolili, veseli, da so le deklico dobili. On ji seže v roko in si misli: — O, ko bi bil zdaj tam, kjer so zlati ptiči! —

Kakor bi z očmi trenil, je bil pri zlatih ptičih: on, morska deklica in konj. Vsi veseli ogledujejo konja, tako lepega in ognja polnega. Ročno mu prineso najlepšega zlatega ptiča v najlepši zlati kletki, ko še s konja ni stopil. Toda kakor hitro je dobil ptiča in prijel deklico za roko, si je mislil: — O, ko bi bil zdaj pri medvedu! —

Takoj je bil že pri medvedu on, morska deklica, konj in zlati ptič. Medved mu reče: »Zdaj imaš vse in sreča te čaka. Samo enega se varuj: varuj se kupovati mesa z vislic!« Medved to izgovori in gre svojo pot.

Mladenič pa jezdi z morsko deklico dalje proti domu in pride v mesto. V mestu je vrelo skupaj polno ljudi. To se mu je čudno zdelo in povprašal je prvega, ki je prišel mimo njega, kaj to pomeni. Ta mu pove, da peljejo dva tatova obesit. Stopi bliže, da bi videl, kdo sta ta dva nesrečnika. Toda joj! V njiju spozna svoja starejša brata. Vpraša, kaj sta storila, in povedo mu, da sta zelo veliko pokradla. Smilita se mu, saj sta

vendar brata. Zato vpraša, ali ju je mogoče rešiti. »O, pač,« mu reko, »kdor plača še enkrat toliko, kolikor sta vzela.« Ker je imel še od doma dovolj denarja, našteje odkupnino in gre svojo pot iz mesta.

Ko sta brata zvedela, da sta rešena smrti, bi rada vedela, kdo ju je odkupil, in vprašala sta vsakega, kje je njun rešitelj. Pokazali so jima pot, po kateri je šel iz mesta.

Gresta za njim, in ko ga zagledata, spoznata, da je njun brat in da nese zlato ptico domov. Zbala sta se, da bi doma ne povedal, kaj se je z njima že zgodilo. Iz zavisti sta ga ubila in pustila mrtvega na cesti. Vzela sta konja, morsko deklico in zlato ptico in šla proti domu.

Vse se ju je veselilo, posebno pa oče — kralj. Konja so dali v hlev, toda odsihmal se je tako shudil, da ni smel nihče k njemu, in so mu morali z vrha dajati zobanja. Tudi morska deklica je bila tako žalostna, da ni mogla besede spregovoriti. Zlata ptica je vedno nosila povešeno glavo in tudi ni dala glasu od sebe. Vsi so mislili, da jo bo zdaj zdaj konec.

Tedaj pa pride medved do mrliča na poti. Odkoplje neko korenino, jo stolče na kamnu, kane sok mrtvemu v usta in mladenič oživi in ozdravi. Nato medved izgine in nič več ni bilo slišati o njem. Mladenič pa gre v strgani obleki domov. Nihče ga ni spoznal. Vpraša po svojem konju, a vse ga debelo gleda in misli, da je blazen. Pokažejo mu konja v hlevu in povedo, da ne sme nihče v njegovo bližino. On gre k njemu. Ko ga konj zagleda, začne veselo rezgetati in se mu da božati in gladiti, kot bi bil najbolj krotka žival. Vse strmi. Nato spet vpraša: »Kje je moja ptica, zlaj:a ptica? Dajte mi jo nazaj!«

Šel je naravnost v kraljevo stanovanje, v tisto sobo, kjer je visela kletka z zlato ptico. Komaj ga ptica zagleda, začne na ves glas tako nebeško prepevati, da

se je razlegalo po vsem gradu, kot bi godli sami nebeški angelci. Ko kralj sliši ptico tako prepevati, prihiti v sobo, iz druge sobe pa morska deklica, ki se ji je to čudno zazdelo. Komaj zagleda mladeniča, razpne bele ročice, skoči k njemu, ga objame, se ga oklene in pritisne na srce, kakor bi ga več ne hotela izpustiti.

Oče je bil priča vsemu temu in ni vedel, kaj naj reče. Spozna svojega sina, in ko izve, kako sta brata z njim ravnala, in kaj se je z njima godilo, se razhudi ter zapove oba starejša sinova obesiti, ker sta to tudi zaslužila. Mlajšemu pa je dal kraljestvo in naredili so veliko svatovščino, kajti oženil se je z lepo morsko deklico.",2470
1,JORINDA AND JORINDEL,"There was once an old castle, that stood in the middle of a deep gloomy
wood, and in the castle lived an old fairy. Now this fairy could take
any shape she pleased. All the day long she flew about in the form of
an owl, or crept about the country like a cat; but at night she always
became an old woman again. When any young man came within a hundred
paces of her castle, he became quite fixed, and could not move a step
till she came and set him free; which she would not do till he had given
her his word never to come there again: but when any pretty maiden came
within that space she was changed into a bird, and the fairy put her
into a cage, and hung her up in a chamber in the castle. There were
seven hundred of these cages hanging in the castle, and all with
beautiful birds in them.

Now there was once a maiden whose name was Jorinda. She was prettier
than all the pretty girls that ever were seen before, and a shepherd
lad, whose name was Jorindel, was very fond of her, and they were soon
to be married. One day they went to walk in the wood, that they might be
alone; and Jorindel said, ‘We must take care that we don’t go too near
to the fairy’s castle.’ It was a beautiful evening; the last rays of the
setting sun shone bright through the long stems of the trees upon
the green underwood beneath, and the turtle-doves sang from the tall
birches.

Jorinda sat down to gaze upon the sun; Jorindel sat by her side; and
both felt sad, they knew not why; but it seemed as if they were to be
parted from one another for ever. They had wandered a long way; and when
they looked to see which way they should go home, they found themselves
at a loss to know what path to take.

The sun was setting fast, and already half of its circle had sunk behind
the hill: Jorindel on a sudden looked behind him, and saw through the
bushes that they had, without knowing it, sat down close under the old
walls of the castle. Then he shrank for fear, turned pale, and trembled.
Jorinda was just singing,

 ‘The ring-dove sang from the willow spray,
  Well-a-day! Well-a-day!
  He mourn’d for the fate of his darling mate,
  Well-a-day!’

when her song stopped suddenly. Jorindel turned to see the reason, and
beheld his Jorinda changed into a nightingale, so that her song ended
with a mournful _jug, jug_. An owl with fiery eyes flew three times
round them, and three times screamed:

 ‘Tu whu! Tu whu! Tu whu!’

Jorindel could not move; he stood fixed as a stone, and could neither
weep, nor speak, nor stir hand or foot. And now the sun went quite down;
the gloomy night came; the owl flew into a bush; and a moment after the
old fairy came forth pale and meagre, with staring eyes, and a nose and
chin that almost met one another.

She mumbled something to herself, seized the nightingale, and went away
with it in her hand. Poor Jorindel saw the nightingale was gone--but
what could he do? He could not speak, he could not move from the spot
where he stood. At last the fairy came back and sang with a hoarse
voice:

 ‘Till the prisoner is fast,
  And her doom is cast,
  There stay! Oh, stay!
  When the charm is around her,
  And the spell has bound her,
  Hie away! away!’

On a sudden Jorindel found himself free. Then he fell on his knees
before the fairy, and prayed her to give him back his dear Jorinda: but
she laughed at him, and said he should never see her again; then she
went her way.

He prayed, he wept, he sorrowed, but all in vain. ‘Alas!’ he said, ‘what
will become of me?’ He could not go back to his own home, so he went to
a strange village, and employed himself in keeping sheep. Many a time
did he walk round and round as near to the hated castle as he dared go,
but all in vain; he heard or saw nothing of Jorinda.

At last he dreamt one night that he found a beautiful purple flower,
and that in the middle of it lay a costly pearl; and he dreamt that he
plucked the flower, and went with it in his hand into the castle, and
that everything he touched with it was disenchanted, and that there he
found his Jorinda again.

In the morning when he awoke, he began to search over hill and dale for
this pretty flower; and eight long days he sought for it in vain: but
on the ninth day, early in the morning, he found the beautiful purple
flower; and in the middle of it was a large dewdrop, as big as a costly
pearl. Then he plucked the flower, and set out and travelled day and
night, till he came again to the castle.

He walked nearer than a hundred paces to it, and yet he did not become
fixed as before, but found that he could go quite close up to the door.
Jorindel was very glad indeed to see this. Then he touched the door with
the flower, and it sprang open; so that he went in through the court,
and listened when he heard so many birds singing. At last he came to the
chamber where the fairy sat, with the seven hundred birds singing in
the seven hundred cages. When she saw Jorindel she was very angry, and
screamed with rage; but she could not come within two yards of him, for
the flower he held in his hand was his safeguard. He looked around at
the birds, but alas! there were many, many nightingales, and how then
should he find out which was his Jorinda? While he was thinking what to
do, he saw the fairy had taken down one of the cages, and was making the
best of her way off through the door. He ran or flew after her, touched
the cage with the flower, and Jorinda stood before him, and threw her
arms round his neck looking as beautiful as ever, as beautiful as when
they walked together in the wood.

Then he touched all the other birds with the flower, so that they all
took their old forms again; and he took Jorinda home, where they were
married, and lived happily together many years: and so did a good many
other lads, whose maidens had been forced to sing in the old fairy’s
cages by themselves, much longer than they liked.",1146,jorinda in joringel,"Nekoč je stal sredi velike, črne hoste star grad. Tam je živela čarovnica.
Podnevi se je spreminjala v mačko ali sovo. Zvečer pa je spet postala človek. K sebi je znala zvabiti divjačino in ptiče in jih je ujela, zaklala, skuhala ali spekla. Če se je kdo približal njenemu gradu na sto korakov, je moral obstati in se ni mogel premakniti z mesta, dokler mu starka ni dovolila. Če je pa stopila deklica v njen čarobni krog, jo je spremenila v ptico, jo zaprla v kletko in odnesla v grad. V gradu je imela že sedem tisoč takih kletk.
No, pa je tedaj živela deklica z imenom Jorinda. Lepša je bila od vseh drugih deklic. Ona in lepi mladenič Joringel sta se zaobljubila drug drugemu. Nedavno tega je bila zaroka in če sta le mogla, sta tičala skupaj in si gledala v oči.
Nekoč sta šla v hosto na sprehod. ""Glej, da se preveč ne približaš gradu!"" je svaril Joringel.
Bil je lep večer. Zlati sončni žarki so padali skozi črne smreke in grlica je žalostno grulila na stoletni bukvi.
Tedaj je Jorinda pričela jokati, sedla v sončni žarek in tožila. Tudi Joringel je tožil. Pri srcu jima je bilo težko, kakor da morata umreti. Zmanjkalo jima je poti in steze. Iskala sta na vse strani, se zbegala in nista več vedela, kod domov. Pol sonca je še gledalo čez goro, pol ga je bilo zašlo.
Ko je Joringel iskal poti po gošči, je zagledal skozi drevje zidovje starega gradu. Prestrašil se je in srce mu je vztrepetalo, Jorinda pa je zapela:
""Moja ptička je žalostna
in toži, toži, toži.
Tudi srce je žalostno
in toži, toži... Civit, civit, civit.""
Joringel se je ozrl k Jorindi. Jorinda je bila spremenjena v slavčka in zaklicala: ""Šu, hu, hu, hu!""
Joringel se ni mogel premakniti, bil je kakor okamenel. Ni mogel jokati, ne govoriti, niti ganiti z roko ne z nogo.
Tedaj je sonce zašlo. Sova je zletela v grm. Iz grma pa je stopila sključena starka, rumena in koščena, z velikimi, rdečimi očmi in krivim nosom, ki ji je visel do brade. Mrmraje je ujela slavčka, si ga dala na roko in ga odnesla v grad. Joringel se ni mogel ne ganiti ne spregovoriti. Slavčka ni bilo več.
Naposled se je starka vrnila in mrko zamrmrala čudne besede. Tedaj se je Joringel lahko premaknil. Pokleknil je pred čarovnico in jo zaklinjal, naj mu vrne Jorindo. Ona pa se je zarežala, mu obrnila hrbet in odšla. Joringel je klical, jokal in tožil. Vse zaman.
Tedaj je odšel iz gozda in hodil, hodil, da je prišel v tujo vas. Ostal je tam in pasel vaške ovce. Večkrat se je vračal v hosto k staremu gradu, a nikoli preblizu.
Neko noč se mu je sanjalo, da je našel krvavordečo rožo, v njeni čaši se je lesketal biser. Utrgal jo je in šel z njo do gradu: česar se je z rožo dotaknil, je bilo rešeno čara. Nazadnje se mu je še sanjalo, da so mu vrnili Jorindo.
Ko se je zjutraj zbudil, je jel iskati po hribih in dolinah take rože. Iskal jo je devet dni, ko se je deseti dan danil, jo je našel. Bila je krvavordeča, v čaši se je lesketala rosa kakor velik, lep biser. Rožo je nosil vse dni in vse noči do starega gradu.
Ko se je približal gradu na sto korakov, ni okamenel. Ne, stopal je do grajskih vrat, dotaknil se vrat in odprla so se na stežaj. Stopil je na grajsko dvorišče in poslušal, kje je slišal kako ptico. Kje je čivkalo in cvrčalo, tja se je napotil.
Prišel je do velike dvorane in vstopil. V dvorani je bila čarovnica in krmila začarane ptice v sedem tisoč kletkah. Ko pa je zagledala Joringla, se je razjezila. Vreščala je ter puhala ogenj, žolč in strup proti njemu. A bolj ko na tri korake se mu ni mogla približati. On pa se ni niti zmenil zanjo, stopal je od kletke do kletke in se oziral po pticah; a bilo je slavčkov na stotine. Kako bi spoznal Jorindo? Ko je tako iskal, je opazil, da je starka skrivaj pograbila kletko in hitela z njo proti vratom. Tedaj je skočil za njo in se dotaknil čarovnice in kletke z rožo. Čarovnica ni mogla nič več čarati in pred njim je stala Jorinda, lepa kakor nekdaj. In ga je objela.
On pa je spremenil vse ptice v deklice in odšel z Jorindo domov, kjer sta še dolgo in srečno živela.",748
2,"THE STRAW, THE COAL, AND THE BEAN","In a village dwelt a poor old woman, who had gathered together a dish
of beans and wanted to cook them. So she made a fire on her hearth, and
that it might burn the quicker, she lighted it with a handful of straw.
When she was emptying the beans into the pan, one dropped without her
observing it, and lay on the ground beside a straw, and soon afterwards
a burning coal from the fire leapt down to the two. Then the straw
began and said: ‘Dear friends, from whence do you come here?’ The coal
replied: ‘I fortunately sprang out of the fire, and if I had not escaped
by sheer force, my death would have been certain,--I should have been
burnt to ashes.’ The bean said: ‘I too have escaped with a whole skin,
but if the old woman had got me into the pan, I should have been made
into broth without any mercy, like my comrades.’ ‘And would a better
fate have fallen to my lot?’ said the straw. ‘The old woman has
destroyed all my brethren in fire and smoke; she seized sixty of them at
once, and took their lives. I luckily slipped through her fingers.’

‘But what are we to do now?’ said the coal.

‘I think,’ answered the bean, ‘that as we have so fortunately escaped
death, we should keep together like good companions, and lest a new
mischance should overtake us here, we should go away together, and
repair to a foreign country.’

The proposition pleased the two others, and they set out on their way
together. Soon, however, they came to a little brook, and as there was
no bridge or foot-plank, they did not know how they were to get over
it. The straw hit on a good idea, and said: ‘I will lay myself straight
across, and then you can walk over on me as on a bridge.’ The straw
therefore stretched itself from one bank to the other, and the coal,
who was of an impetuous disposition, tripped quite boldly on to the
newly-built bridge. But when she had reached the middle, and heard the
water rushing beneath her, she was after all, afraid, and stood still,
and ventured no farther. The straw, however, began to burn, broke in
two pieces, and fell into the stream. The coal slipped after her, hissed
when she got into the water, and breathed her last. The bean, who had
prudently stayed behind on the shore, could not but laugh at the event,
was unable to stop, and laughed so heartily that she burst. It would
have been all over with her, likewise, if, by good fortune, a tailor who
was travelling in search of work, had not sat down to rest by the brook.
As he had a compassionate heart he pulled out his needle and thread,
and sewed her together. The bean thanked him most prettily, but as the
tailor used black thread, all beans since then have a black seam.",506,slamica ogeljcek in fizolcek,"Pri neki hiši je nekoč živela klepetava gospodinja. Vsak dopoldan je hodila po vasi od hiše do hiše in klepetala. Ko je zazvonilo poldan, je pohitela domov, da bi skuhala kosilo za moža. Kajti mož se je vračal domov z dela ves utrujen in lačen in nikoli ni hotel jesti napol kuhanega fižola. Da bi žena hitreje skuhala, je zakurila ogenj na ognjišču kar s slamo.

Nekega dne pa je z ognjišča padla slamica, nanjo je padel ogelček in iz lonca, v katerem je močno vrela voda, je priletel fižolček.

In na sredi hiše so se pogovorili vsi trije — fižolček, ogelček in slamica — da bi bilo zanje najboljše, če bi zbežali prej, kot jih bo žena vrgla nazaj na ogenj.

Počasi so se zmuznili skozi vrata na dvorišče in se za hramom pobrali navkreber.

Ko so prišli do potoka pri Kozjanci, so videli, da je ves narasel zavoljo dežja.

— Zdaj smo pa tam, je rekel fižolček. Kaj naj storimo, da bomo prišli čez potok?

Slamica je malo pomislila, potem pa je rekla: — Jaz se bom vrgla čez potok, vidva pa drug za drugim pojdita na drugo stran in potem potegnita še mene čez.

Fižolček se je hitro prekotalil prvi, nakar je šel še ogelček.

Slamico je speklo, pa je zarjula:

— Hitro, hitro, ker me peče! Ne morem več trpeti! Ogelček je bil prav na sredini, ko se je slama prežgala

in je padla za ogelčkom v vodo. Takrat se je pa začel fižolček na bregu tako smejati, tako smejati, da mu je trebuh počil.

Čez malo časa je prišel mimo krojač Kulvan z Mečakne, ki je šel v Saržento pomerjat obleko. Zaslišal je klicanje na pomoč. Približal se je in zagledal fižolčka, ki je neusmiljeno jokal in tiščal trebuh skupaj, da mu ne bi črevca ven zletela.

K sreči je imel krojač Kulvan s seboj iglo že z nitjo pretaknjeno. A nit je bila bela, fižolček pa rdeč. Ker pa je bila velika sila, ni kazalo čakati, kot narediti šiv od kraja do konca, takšen, ki bo držal.

Od takrat ima vsak fižolček na sredi bel šiv. ",347
3,THE FROG-PRINCE,"One fine evening a young princess put on her bonnet and clogs, and went
out to take a walk by herself in a wood; and when she came to a cool
spring of water, that rose in the midst of it, she sat herself down
to rest a while. Now she had a golden ball in her hand, which was her
favourite plaything; and she was always tossing it up into the air, and
catching it again as it fell. After a time she threw it up so high that
she missed catching it as it fell; and the ball bounded away, and rolled
along upon the ground, till at last it fell down into the spring. The
princess looked into the spring after her ball, but it was very deep, so
deep that she could not see the bottom of it. Then she began to bewail
her loss, and said, ‘Alas! if I could only get my ball again, I would
give all my fine clothes and jewels, and everything that I have in the
world.’

Whilst she was speaking, a frog put its head out of the water, and said,
‘Princess, why do you weep so bitterly?’ ‘Alas!’ said she, ‘what can you
do for me, you nasty frog? My golden ball has fallen into the spring.’
The frog said, ‘I want not your pearls, and jewels, and fine clothes;
but if you will love me, and let me live with you and eat from off
your golden plate, and sleep upon your bed, I will bring you your ball
again.’ ‘What nonsense,’ thought the princess, ‘this silly frog is
talking! He can never even get out of the spring to visit me, though
he may be able to get my ball for me, and therefore I will tell him he
shall have what he asks.’ So she said to the frog, ‘Well, if you will
bring me my ball, I will do all you ask.’ Then the frog put his head
down, and dived deep under the water; and after a little while he came
up again, with the ball in his mouth, and threw it on the edge of the
spring. As soon as the young princess saw her ball, she ran to pick
it up; and she was so overjoyed to have it in her hand again, that she
never thought of the frog, but ran home with it as fast as she could.
The frog called after her, ‘Stay, princess, and take me with you as you
said,’ But she did not stop to hear a word.

The next day, just as the princess had sat down to dinner, she heard a
strange noise--tap, tap--plash, plash--as if something was coming up the
marble staircase: and soon afterwards there was a gentle knock at the
door, and a little voice cried out and said:

 ‘Open the door, my princess dear,
  Open the door to thy true love here!
  And mind the words that thou and I said
  By the fountain cool, in the greenwood shade.’

Then the princess ran to the door and opened it, and there she saw
the frog, whom she had quite forgotten. At this sight she was sadly
frightened, and shutting the door as fast as she could came back to her
seat. The king, her father, seeing that something had frightened her,
asked her what was the matter. ‘There is a nasty frog,’ said she, ‘at
the door, that lifted my ball for me out of the spring this morning: I
told him that he should live with me here, thinking that he could never
get out of the spring; but there he is at the door, and he wants to come
in.’

While she was speaking the frog knocked again at the door, and said:

 ‘Open the door, my princess dear,
  Open the door to thy true love here!
  And mind the words that thou and I said
  By the fountain cool, in the greenwood shade.’

Then the king said to the young princess, ‘As you have given your word
you must keep it; so go and let him in.’ She did so, and the frog hopped
into the room, and then straight on--tap, tap--plash, plash--from the
bottom of the room to the top, till he came up close to the table where
the princess sat. ‘Pray lift me upon chair,’ said he to the princess,
‘and let me sit next to you.’ As soon as she had done this, the frog
said, ‘Put your plate nearer to me, that I may eat out of it.’ This
she did, and when he had eaten as much as he could, he said, ‘Now I am
tired; carry me upstairs, and put me into your bed.’ And the princess,
though very unwilling, took him up in her hand, and put him upon the
pillow of her own bed, where he slept all night long. As soon as it was
light he jumped up, hopped downstairs, and went out of the house.
‘Now, then,’ thought the princess, ‘at last he is gone, and I shall be
troubled with him no more.’

But she was mistaken; for when night came again she heard the same
tapping at the door; and the frog came once more, and said:

 ‘Open the door, my princess dear,
  Open the door to thy true love here!
  And mind the words that thou and I said
  By the fountain cool, in the greenwood shade.’

And when the princess opened the door the frog came in, and slept upon
her pillow as before, till the morning broke. And the third night he did
the same. But when the princess awoke on the following morning she was
astonished to see, instead of the frog, a handsome prince, gazing on her
with the most beautiful eyes she had ever seen, and standing at the head
of her bed.

He told her that he had been enchanted by a spiteful fairy, who had
changed him into a frog; and that he had been fated so to abide till
some princess should take him out of the spring, and let him eat from
her plate, and sleep upon her bed for three nights. ‘You,’ said the
prince, ‘have broken his cruel charm, and now I have nothing to wish for
but that you should go with me into my father’s kingdom, where I will
marry you, and love you as long as you live.’

The young princess, you may be sure, was not long in saying ‘Yes’ to
all this; and as they spoke a gay coach drove up, with eight beautiful
horses, decked with plumes of feathers and a golden harness; and behind
the coach rode the prince’s servant, faithful Heinrich, who had bewailed
the misfortunes of his dear master during his enchantment so long and so
bitterly, that his heart had well-nigh burst.

They then took leave of the king, and got into the coach with eight
horses, and all set out, full of joy and merriment, for the prince’s
kingdom, which they reached safely; and there they lived happily a great
many years.",1202,zabji princ,"Za devetimi gorami in devetimi vodami je živel kralj, ki je imel devet hčera. Vse so bile lepe, a najmlajša je bila najlepša. Bila je tako lepa, da je bilo še sonce, ki je že marsikaj videlo, vselej očarano, kadar se je postavila pred sončne žarke.

V bližini gradu, kjer je živela, je bil prostran in temačen gozd, sredi katerega je stal mogočen hrast, ki je delal senco majhnemu vodnjaku.

Kadar je bilo vroče, se je lepa princesa rada hladila v senci mogočnega hrasta. Dolgčas je ponavadi preganjala s svojo zlato kroglico; najraje jo je metala v zrak in potem skušala ponovno ujeti.

Nekega dne pa se je zgodilo, da zlata kroglica, ki jo je zalučala v zrak, ni pristala v njenih rokah, temveč v vodnjaku, ki je bil tako globok, da če bi pogledal iz njegovega dna navzgor, bi sredi belega dne videl nebo polno zvezd. Princesa je lahko le nemočno opazovala, kako njena igrača izginja v globini.

Pričela je jokati, saj je imela zlato kroglico, ki ji v vsem kraljestvu ni bilo enake, že od malih nog, sedaj pa jo je za vedno izgubila v globokem vodnjaku.

Nenadoma pa je jokanje prekinil glas, ki je rekel: ""Čemu bridke solze, kraljeva hči? Vodnjak je vendar že dovolj poln.""

Princesa je pogledala naokrog, da bi videla, od kod prihaja glas, in zagledala žabona, ki je nad gladino držal svojo debelo sluzasto glavo.

""Fuj,"" je rekla. ""Ti mali, sluzasti čofotač! Si ti pravkar spregovoril?""

""Jaz in nihče drug,"" je odgovoril žabon.

""Kako čudno, nikoli še nisem slišala žabe govoriti,"" je rekla princesa. ""Če te že zanima, jočem za svojo zlato kroglico, ki mi je padla v vodnjak.""

""Ne joči več,"" je odvrnil žabon, ""lahko ti pomagam. Ampak, kaj bom dobil v zameno, če ti prinesem kroglico.""

""Karkoli ti srce poželi, dragi žabon,"" se je razveselila princesa. ""Moje obleke, moj nakit, lahko tudi zlato krono, ki jo nosim v laseh.""

""Obleke, nakit in krone me ne zanimajo,"" je rekel žabon. ""Ampak, če me boš ljubila, če mi boš delala družbo, če mi boš dovolila sedeti s tabo za mizo, jesti iz tvojega zlatega krožnika, piti iz tvoje zlate čaše, če bom lahko spal v tvoji postelji – če in samo če mi boš vse to obljubila, potem se bom potopil na dno vodnjaka in ti prinesel zlato kroglico.""

""Vse obljubim, vse,"" je rekla princesa s figo v žepu, ""samo prinesi mi kroglico.""

Takoj, ko je slišal obljubo, se je žabon potopil. Čez nekaj minut je bila zlata kroglica na suhem.

Kraljeva hči se je nadvse razveselila svoje čudovite igrače; pograbila jo je in takoj stekla proč. Žabonu se ni niti zahvalila, kaj šele, da bi izpolnila, kar je obljubila.

""Počakaj! Počakaj!"" je za njo klical žabon. A zaman. Princesa je odvihrala domov in že na pol poti čisto pozabila svoje obljube ter ubogega žabona.

Naslednji dan, ko je s kraljem in dvorjani sedela za mizo ter jedla iz svojega zlatega krožnika, je bilo slišati, kako nekaj čofotajoč prihaja po marmornih stopnicah. In ko je čofotanje prenehalo, je potrkalo na vratih.

""Najmlajša kraljeva hči, odpri vrata!"" je rekel glas za vrati.

Princesa je vstala, da bi pogledala, kdo jo kliče, ampak ko je odprla vrata in zagledala žabona, jih je brž zaloputnila nazaj ter se precej bleda vrnila k mizi. 

Kralj je opazil njeno vznemirjenost, zato je vprašal, kdo je bil. Da ni morda kak velikan pred vrati, ki bi jo želel ukrasti.

""Ne, ne,"" je rekla. ""Ni velikan, samo sluzast žabon je.""

""In kaj hoče žabon?"" je vprašal kralj.

Princesa mu je razložila, kako je prejšnji dan izgubila svojo zlato kroglico in kako ji je žabon pomagal. Povedala je tudi, kaj vse mu je obljubila. ""Nikoli si ne bi mislila, da bo dejansko zahteval obljubljeno. Saj je vendar žabon, ki cele dneve čofota po vodi,"" je dejala.

Tisti trenutek je vnovič potrkalo in glas za vrati je rekel: ""Najmlajša kraljeva hči, odpri vrata! Ali si pozabila na svoje obljube pri globokem vodnjaku?""

Kralj je tedaj s trdnim glasom rekel: ""Obljuba dela dolg. Spusti ga noter!""

Brez, da bi kaj rekla, je princesa vstala in odprla vrata. Žabon ji je poskakujoč sledil nazaj do njenega stola in takoj, ko je sedla, rekel: ""Dvigni me."" Obotavljala se je, zato jo je kralj strogo pogledal.

Ko je bil žabon na mizi, je rekel: ""Potisni krožnik malce bliže, da bova lahko skupaj jedla."" Čeprav nerada, je tako storila.

Žabon je užival v večerji, že dolgo ni tako dobro jedel, princesi pa grižljaji niso šli v slast.

Ko se je žabon dodobra nasitil, je rekel: ""Utrujen sem. Odnesi me sedaj v svojo sobo, da bova skupaj spala na tvoji postelji?""

Ob teh besedah je princesa zajokala. Misel, da bi spala z mrzlim, sluzastim bitjem, jo je strašila in vznemirjala. Toda kralj ji ni dovolil, da bi prelomila obljubo, zato je previdno prijela žabona z dvema prstoma in ga odnesla v svojo sobo.

Tam ga je odložila v kot, toda takoj, ko je legla v posteljo, je priskakljal do nje in rekel: ""Tako sem utrujen, da bom gotovo dobro spal. Dvigni me na posteljo ali pa te zatožim očetu.""

Te besede so princeso strašno razjezile. Besna je zgrabila žabona in ga z vso močjo zalučala v steno. Tedaj pa se je zgodilo nekaj nepričakovanega - žabon se je spremenil v postavnega princa.

Izkazalo se je, da je princesa s svojim dejanjem izničila urok, ki ga je lepemu princu namenila hudobna čarovnica. Ta ga je zahrbtno začarala v žabona in le kraljeva hči, ki mu bo izkazala najmočnejša čustva, najsi bodo to čustva ljubezni ali sovraštva, je lahko pretrgala urok. Princesa je to nevede storila in princ je bil osvobojen.

Med njima je takoj vzklila ljubezen. Z očetovim dovoljenjem sta se zaročila ter kmalu zatem odpotovala v prinčevo kraljestvo.

Tam so se ju vsi zelo razveselili in jima priredili velikansko zabavo, ki je trajala tri dni in tri noči. Hudobna čarovnica, ki je iz zraka videla prihajati kočijo z mladima zaljubljencema, pa je tako osupnila, da je padla z metle in si zlomila nogo. ",1003
4,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"Hard by a great forest dwelt a poor wood-cutter with his wife and his
two children. The boy was called Hansel and the girl Gretel. He had
little to bite and to break, and once when great dearth fell on the
land, he could no longer procure even daily bread. Now when he thought
over this by night in his bed, and tossed about in his anxiety, he
groaned and said to his wife: ‘What is to become of us? How are we
to feed our poor children, when we no longer have anything even for
ourselves?’ ‘I’ll tell you what, husband,’ answered the woman, ‘early
tomorrow morning we will take the children out into the forest to where
it is the thickest; there we will light a fire for them, and give each
of them one more piece of bread, and then we will go to our work and
leave them alone. They will not find the way home again, and we shall be
rid of them.’ ‘No, wife,’ said the man, ‘I will not do that; how can I
bear to leave my children alone in the forest?--the wild animals would
soon come and tear them to pieces.’ ‘O, you fool!’ said she, ‘then we
must all four die of hunger, you may as well plane the planks for our
coffins,’ and she left him no peace until he consented. ‘But I feel very
sorry for the poor children, all the same,’ said the man.

The two children had also not been able to sleep for hunger, and had
heard what their stepmother had said to their father. Gretel wept
bitter tears, and said to Hansel: ‘Now all is over with us.’ ‘Be quiet,
Gretel,’ said Hansel, ‘do not distress yourself, I will soon find a way
to help us.’ And when the old folks had fallen asleep, he got up, put
on his little coat, opened the door below, and crept outside. The moon
shone brightly, and the white pebbles which lay in front of the house
glittered like real silver pennies. Hansel stooped and stuffed the
little pocket of his coat with as many as he could get in. Then he went
back and said to Gretel: ‘Be comforted, dear little sister, and sleep in
peace, God will not forsake us,’ and he lay down again in his bed. When
day dawned, but before the sun had risen, the woman came and awoke the
two children, saying: ‘Get up, you sluggards! we are going into the
forest to fetch wood.’ She gave each a little piece of bread, and said:
‘There is something for your dinner, but do not eat it up before then,
for you will get nothing else.’ Gretel took the bread under her apron,
as Hansel had the pebbles in his pocket. Then they all set out together
on the way to the forest. When they had walked a short time, Hansel
stood still and peeped back at the house, and did so again and again.
His father said: ‘Hansel, what are you looking at there and staying
behind for? Pay attention, and do not forget how to use your legs.’ ‘Ah,
father,’ said Hansel, ‘I am looking at my little white cat, which is
sitting up on the roof, and wants to say goodbye to me.’ The wife said:
‘Fool, that is not your little cat, that is the morning sun which is
shining on the chimneys.’ Hansel, however, had not been looking back at
the cat, but had been constantly throwing one of the white pebble-stones
out of his pocket on the road.

When they had reached the middle of the forest, the father said: ‘Now,
children, pile up some wood, and I will light a fire that you may not
be cold.’ Hansel and Gretel gathered brushwood together, as high as a
little hill. The brushwood was lighted, and when the flames were burning
very high, the woman said: ‘Now, children, lay yourselves down by the
fire and rest, we will go into the forest and cut some wood. When we
have done, we will come back and fetch you away.’

Hansel and Gretel sat by the fire, and when noon came, each ate a little
piece of bread, and as they heard the strokes of the wood-axe they
believed that their father was near. It was not the axe, however, but
a branch which he had fastened to a withered tree which the wind was
blowing backwards and forwards. And as they had been sitting such a long
time, their eyes closed with fatigue, and they fell fast asleep. When
at last they awoke, it was already dark night. Gretel began to cry and
said: ‘How are we to get out of the forest now?’ But Hansel comforted
her and said: ‘Just wait a little, until the moon has risen, and then we
will soon find the way.’ And when the full moon had risen, Hansel took
his little sister by the hand, and followed the pebbles which shone like
newly-coined silver pieces, and showed them the way.

They walked the whole night long, and by break of day came once more
to their father’s house. They knocked at the door, and when the woman
opened it and saw that it was Hansel and Gretel, she said: ‘You naughty
children, why have you slept so long in the forest?--we thought you were
never coming back at all!’ The father, however, rejoiced, for it had cut
him to the heart to leave them behind alone.

Not long afterwards, there was once more great dearth throughout the
land, and the children heard their mother saying at night to their
father: ‘Everything is eaten again, we have one half loaf left, and that
is the end. The children must go, we will take them farther into the
wood, so that they will not find their way out again; there is no other
means of saving ourselves!’ The man’s heart was heavy, and he thought:
‘It would be better for you to share the last mouthful with your
children.’ The woman, however, would listen to nothing that he had to
say, but scolded and reproached him. He who says A must say B, likewise,
and as he had yielded the first time, he had to do so a second time
also.

The children, however, were still awake and had heard the conversation.
When the old folks were asleep, Hansel again got up, and wanted to go
out and pick up pebbles as he had done before, but the woman had locked
the door, and Hansel could not get out. Nevertheless he comforted his
little sister, and said: ‘Do not cry, Gretel, go to sleep quietly, the
good God will help us.’

Early in the morning came the woman, and took the children out of their
beds. Their piece of bread was given to them, but it was still smaller
than the time before. On the way into the forest Hansel crumbled his
in his pocket, and often stood still and threw a morsel on the ground.
‘Hansel, why do you stop and look round?’ said the father, ‘go on.’ ‘I
am looking back at my little pigeon which is sitting on the roof, and
wants to say goodbye to me,’ answered Hansel. ‘Fool!’ said the woman,
‘that is not your little pigeon, that is the morning sun that is shining
on the chimney.’ Hansel, however little by little, threw all the crumbs
on the path.

The woman led the children still deeper into the forest, where they had
never in their lives been before. Then a great fire was again made, and
the mother said: ‘Just sit there, you children, and when you are tired
you may sleep a little; we are going into the forest to cut wood, and in
the evening when we are done, we will come and fetch you away.’ When
it was noon, Gretel shared her piece of bread with Hansel, who had
scattered his by the way. Then they fell asleep and evening passed, but
no one came to the poor children. They did not awake until it was dark
night, and Hansel comforted his little sister and said: ‘Just wait,
Gretel, until the moon rises, and then we shall see the crumbs of bread
which I have strewn about, they will show us our way home again.’ When
the moon came they set out, but they found no crumbs, for the many
thousands of birds which fly about in the woods and fields had picked
them all up. Hansel said to Gretel: ‘We shall soon find the way,’ but
they did not find it. They walked the whole night and all the next day
too from morning till evening, but they did not get out of the forest,
and were very hungry, for they had nothing to eat but two or three
berries, which grew on the ground. And as they were so weary that their
legs would carry them no longer, they lay down beneath a tree and fell
asleep.

It was now three mornings since they had left their father’s house. They
began to walk again, but they always came deeper into the forest, and if
help did not come soon, they must die of hunger and weariness. When it
was mid-day, they saw a beautiful snow-white bird sitting on a bough,
which sang so delightfully that they stood still and listened to it. And
when its song was over, it spread its wings and flew away before them,
and they followed it until they reached a little house, on the roof of
which it alighted; and when they approached the little house they saw
that it was built of bread and covered with cakes, but that the windows
were of clear sugar. ‘We will set to work on that,’ said Hansel, ‘and
have a good meal. I will eat a bit of the roof, and you Gretel, can eat
some of the window, it will taste sweet.’ Hansel reached up above, and
broke off a little of the roof to try how it tasted, and Gretel leant
against the window and nibbled at the panes. Then a soft voice cried
from the parlour:

 ‘Nibble, nibble, gnaw,
  Who is nibbling at my little house?’

The children answered:

 ‘The wind, the wind,
  The heaven-born wind,’

and went on eating without disturbing themselves. Hansel, who liked the
taste of the roof, tore down a great piece of it, and Gretel pushed out
the whole of one round window-pane, sat down, and enjoyed herself with
it. Suddenly the door opened, and a woman as old as the hills, who
supported herself on crutches, came creeping out. Hansel and Gretel were
so terribly frightened that they let fall what they had in their
hands. The old woman, however, nodded her head, and said: ‘Oh, you dear
children, who has brought you here? do come in, and stay with me. No
harm shall happen to you.’ She took them both by the hand, and led them
into her little house. Then good food was set before them, milk and
pancakes, with sugar, apples, and nuts. Afterwards two pretty little
beds were covered with clean white linen, and Hansel and Gretel lay down
in them, and thought they were in heaven.

The old woman had only pretended to be so kind; she was in reality
a wicked witch, who lay in wait for children, and had only built the
little house of bread in order to entice them there. When a child fell
into her power, she killed it, cooked and ate it, and that was a feast
day with her. Witches have red eyes, and cannot see far, but they have
a keen scent like the beasts, and are aware when human beings draw near.
When Hansel and Gretel came into her neighbourhood, she laughed with
malice, and said mockingly: ‘I have them, they shall not escape me
again!’ Early in the morning before the children were awake, she was
already up, and when she saw both of them sleeping and looking so
pretty, with their plump and rosy cheeks she muttered to herself: ‘That
will be a dainty mouthful!’ Then she seized Hansel with her shrivelled
hand, carried him into a little stable, and locked him in behind a
grated door. Scream as he might, it would not help him. Then she went to
Gretel, shook her till she awoke, and cried: ‘Get up, lazy thing, fetch
some water, and cook something good for your brother, he is in the
stable outside, and is to be made fat. When he is fat, I will eat him.’
Gretel began to weep bitterly, but it was all in vain, for she was
forced to do what the wicked witch commanded.

And now the best food was cooked for poor Hansel, but Gretel got nothing
but crab-shells. Every morning the woman crept to the little stable, and
cried: ‘Hansel, stretch out your finger that I may feel if you will soon
be fat.’ Hansel, however, stretched out a little bone to her, and
the old woman, who had dim eyes, could not see it, and thought it was
Hansel’s finger, and was astonished that there was no way of fattening
him. When four weeks had gone by, and Hansel still remained thin, she
was seized with impatience and would not wait any longer. ‘Now, then,
Gretel,’ she cried to the girl, ‘stir yourself, and bring some water.
Let Hansel be fat or lean, tomorrow I will kill him, and cook him.’ Ah,
how the poor little sister did lament when she had to fetch the water,
and how her tears did flow down her cheeks! ‘Dear God, do help us,’ she
cried. ‘If the wild beasts in the forest had but devoured us, we should
at any rate have died together.’ ‘Just keep your noise to yourself,’
said the old woman, ‘it won’t help you at all.’

Early in the morning, Gretel had to go out and hang up the cauldron with
the water, and light the fire. ‘We will bake first,’ said the old woman,
‘I have already heated the oven, and kneaded the dough.’ She pushed poor
Gretel out to the oven, from which flames of fire were already darting.
‘Creep in,’ said the witch, ‘and see if it is properly heated, so that
we can put the bread in.’ And once Gretel was inside, she intended to
shut the oven and let her bake in it, and then she would eat her, too.
But Gretel saw what she had in mind, and said: ‘I do not know how I am
to do it; how do I get in?’ ‘Silly goose,’ said the old woman. ‘The door
is big enough; just look, I can get in myself!’ and she crept up and
thrust her head into the oven. Then Gretel gave her a push that drove
her far into it, and shut the iron door, and fastened the bolt. Oh! then
she began to howl quite horribly, but Gretel ran away and the godless
witch was miserably burnt to death.

Gretel, however, ran like lightning to Hansel, opened his little stable,
and cried: ‘Hansel, we are saved! The old witch is dead!’ Then Hansel
sprang like a bird from its cage when the door is opened. How they did
rejoice and embrace each other, and dance about and kiss each other! And
as they had no longer any need to fear her, they went into the witch’s
house, and in every corner there stood chests full of pearls and jewels.
‘These are far better than pebbles!’ said Hansel, and thrust into his
pockets whatever could be got in, and Gretel said: ‘I, too, will take
something home with me,’ and filled her pinafore full. ‘But now we must
be off,’ said Hansel, ‘that we may get out of the witch’s forest.’

When they had walked for two hours, they came to a great stretch of
water. ‘We cannot cross,’ said Hansel, ‘I see no foot-plank, and no
bridge.’ ‘And there is also no ferry,’ answered Gretel, ‘but a white
duck is swimming there: if I ask her, she will help us over.’ Then she
cried:

 ‘Little duck, little duck, dost thou see,
  Hansel and Gretel are waiting for thee?
  There’s never a plank, or bridge in sight,
  Take us across on thy back so white.’

The duck came to them, and Hansel seated himself on its back, and told
his sister to sit by him. ‘No,’ replied Gretel, ‘that will be too heavy
for the little duck; she shall take us across, one after the other.’ The
good little duck did so, and when they were once safely across and had
walked for a short time, the forest seemed to be more and more familiar
to them, and at length they saw from afar their father’s house. Then
they began to run, rushed into the parlour, and threw themselves round
their father’s neck. The man had not known one happy hour since he had
left the children in the forest; the woman, however, was dead. Gretel
emptied her pinafore until pearls and precious stones ran about the
room, and Hansel threw one handful after another out of his pocket to
add to them. Then all anxiety was at an end, and they lived together
in perfect happiness. My tale is done, there runs a mouse; whosoever
catches it, may make himself a big fur cap out of it.",2952,janko in metka,"Živel je oče, ki je imel dva otroka, Janka in Metko. Ker so bili zelo revni in niso imeli kaj za pod zob, se je nekega dne odločil, da ju bo odpeljal v gozd in pustil tam. Upal je, da se jima bo uspelo rešiti in da bosta našla kakšnega dobrotnika, ki ju bo vzel s seboj in ju nahranil.

Rekel je: »Moram v gozd po drva. Pridita z mano in v gozdu naberita sladkih borovnic in jagod.« Otroka sta se razveselila, da ju bo oče vzel s seboj, saj nista pričakovala, da ju bo kar pustil v gozdu. Kmalu je oče izginil in ostala sta sama sredi temačnega gozda. Začela sta iskati očeta in zašla globoko v gozd. Zdelo se jim je da slišita zvok sekire, zato sta nadaljevala s hojo. Na travniku sta zagledala sladkih borovnic in jagod in jih začela nabirati. Kmalu je zvok sekire utihnil, otroka pa nista več našla poti nazaj. Oče se ni oglašal na njune klice in počasi se je sonce skrilo za krošnje dreves in nastopila je trdna noč. Otroka je bilo strah, še posebej mlajšo Metko. Janko se je domislil in splezal na vrh najvišjega drevesa. Od tam je v bližini zagledal luč, se razveselil in z Metko sta se odpravila proti svetlobi. Bila sta lačna in izčrpana, ko sta le prišla do hiške. Tam pa ju je čakalo presenečenje. Nista mogla verjeti svojim očem. Pred njima je stala hiša iz medenjakov in sladkorja, streha pa je bila iz čokolade, bombonov in sladkega marcipana. Janko se ni obotavljal – hitro je odlomil del strehe in jo dal sestrici. Odlomil je še zase kos sladke strehe, ko se je pred njima prikazala strašna čarovnica in vprašala: »Kdo mi uničuje mojo lepo hiško«. Otroka sta se prestrašila, ona pa ju je hitro vtaknila v kletko. Metko je imela za sužnjo. Morala je skrbeti zanjo in opravljati vsa gospodinjska dela, ji kuhati, čistiti in prati. Janka je čarovnica vtaknila v kletko in ga pitala s sladkarijami, da bi se čim prej poredil. Vsak dan je preverjala če je že dovolj debel, da bi ga skuhala in požrla. Toda Janko je bil prebrisan in ji namesto prsta vedno pomolil palčko. Čarovnica se je čudila, da je fant kljub vsem sladkarijam še vedno tako koščen. Nekega dne pa ji je prekipelo in ukazala je Metki naj zakuri ogenj, da bo požrla njenega brata za kosilo. Nič ni pomagalo, da je Metka neutolažljivo jokala. Metka je morala nalagati drva v peč, čarovnica pa jo je spraševala ali dobro gori. Metka ji je odgovorila, da ne more sama pogledati tako visoko. Čarovnica se je razjezila in sama pogledala v peč – takrat pa je Metka izkoristila priložnost in jo porinila v gorečo peč. Čarovnica je zavreščala in kmalu zgorela do smrti. Metka je hitro osvobodila Janka in bila sta presrečna, da sta končno rešena. Čarovnici sta vzela bisere, ki sta jih našla v skrinjici. Tekla sta kar so ju nesle noge, da bi našla očeta in dom.

Medtem je bilo njunemu očetu strašno žal, da ju je pustil sama v strašnem gozdu. Vsak dan ju je iskal in upal, da sta otroka še živa in zdrava. Nekje na poti so se srečali in si presrečni padli v objem. Oče je otroka prosil za odpuščanje in skupaj so se vrnili domov ter srečno živeli do konca svojih dni.

5,"THE MOUSE, THE BIRD, AND THE SAUSAGE","Once upon a time, a mouse, a bird, and a sausage, entered into
partnership and set up house together. For a long time all went well;
they lived in great comfort, and prospered so far as to be able to add
considerably to their stores. The bird’s duty was to fly daily into the
wood and bring in fuel; the mouse fetched the water, and the sausage saw
to the cooking.

When people are too well off they always begin to long for something
new. And so it came to pass, that the bird, while out one day, met a
fellow bird, to whom he boastfully expatiated on the excellence of his
household arrangements. But the other bird sneered at him for being a
poor simpleton, who did all the hard work, while the other two stayed
at home and had a good time of it. For, when the mouse had made the fire
and fetched in the water, she could retire into her little room and rest
until it was time to set the table. The sausage had only to watch the
pot to see that the food was properly cooked, and when it was near
dinner-time, he just threw himself into the broth, or rolled in and out
among the vegetables three or four times, and there they were, buttered,
and salted, and ready to be served. Then, when the bird came home and
had laid aside his burden, they sat down to table, and when they had
finished their meal, they could sleep their fill till the following
morning: and that was really a very delightful life.

Influenced by those remarks, the bird next morning refused to bring in
the wood, telling the others that he had been their servant long enough,
and had been a fool into the bargain, and that it was now time to make a
change, and to try some other way of arranging the work. Beg and pray
as the mouse and the sausage might, it was of no use; the bird remained
master of the situation, and the venture had to be made. They therefore
drew lots, and it fell to the sausage to bring in the wood, to the mouse
to cook, and to the bird to fetch the water.

And now what happened? The sausage started in search of wood, the bird
made the fire, and the mouse put on the pot, and then these two waited
till the sausage returned with the fuel for the following day. But the
sausage remained so long away, that they became uneasy, and the bird
flew out to meet him. He had not flown far, however, when he came across
a dog who, having met the sausage, had regarded him as his legitimate
booty, and so seized and swallowed him. The bird complained to the dog
of this bare-faced robbery, but nothing he said was of any avail, for
the dog answered that he found false credentials on the sausage, and
that was the reason his life had been forfeited.

He picked up the wood, and flew sadly home, and told the mouse all he
had seen and heard. They were both very unhappy, but agreed to make the
best of things and to remain with one another.

So now the bird set the table, and the mouse looked after the food and,
wishing to prepare it in the same way as the sausage, by rolling in and
out among the vegetables to salt and butter them, she jumped into the
pot; but she stopped short long before she reached the bottom, having
already parted not only with her skin and hair, but also with life.

Presently the bird came in and wanted to serve up the dinner, but he
could nowhere see the cook. In his alarm and flurry, he threw the wood
here and there about the floor, called and searched, but no cook was to
be found. Then some of the wood that had been carelessly thrown down,
caught fire and began to blaze. The bird hastened to fetch some water,
but his pail fell into the well, and he after it, and as he was unable
to recover himself, he was drowned.",707,misek pticka in klobasa,"Pred davnimi časi so mišek, ptička in klobasa pričeli svojo navezo in pričeli tudi stanovati skupaj. Zelo dolgo jim je šlo odlično; živeli so v velikem udobju in uspeli svoje zaloge znatno povečevati. Naloga ptičke je bila, da je dnevno poletela proti gozdu in poskrbela za kurivo; mišek je prinašal vodo, klobasa pa se je lotila kuhanja.

Ko pa nam gre prelepo, pričnemo vedno hrepeneti po nečem novem. In tako se je po določenem času ptička nekega dne prijatelju ptičku prav na veliko pohvalila, kako odlično imajo urejeno v njihovem gospodinjstvu. Prijatelj ptiček pa je prhnil in ji rekel, da je le ona tista, ki postori vso trdo delo, medtem ko sostanovalca doma uživata na njen račun. Ker ko je mišek zakuril in prinesel vodo, je lahko počival v svoji mali sobici in ostal tam vse do takrat, ko je bilo potrebno pripraviti mizo. Klobasa je morala le gledati v lonec in paziti, da se hrana dobro kuha in ko se je bližal čas kosila, se je le vrgla v enolončnico ali se povaljala med zelenjavo trikrat, štirikrat in to je bilo vse, hrana je bila tako namaščena in osoljena pripravljena za postrežbo.

Ko je ptička prišla domov in odložila svoje breme, sta se sostanovalca usedla k mizi in ko sta končala z obrokom, sta lahko vse do jutra spala: verjel bi, da je to prav lagodno življenje.

Pod vplivom teh opomb je ptička naslednje jutro protestirala in ni hotela prinesti lesa, sostanovalcema je povedala, da je že predolgo njuna sužnja in da sta jo s to kupčijo prinesla okoli ter da je skrajni čas za spremembo in drugačno razporeditev dela med njimi. Vsaka prošnja in moledovanje miška in klobase je bila odveč. Ptička je vztrajala pri svojem in spremembe so bile neizogibne. Tako so žrebali in določili, da bo les prinesla klobasa mišku, ki bo kuhal in vodo bo zdaj prinesla ptička.

In kaj se je zgodilo? Klobasa je pričela z iskanjem lesa, ptička je zakurila in mišek je pristavil lonec, tako sta zadnja dva čakala, da se klobasa vrne z lesom, ki ga potrebujejo za kosilo naslednji dan. Ampak klobase dolgo ni bilo in postalo jima je prav nelagodno, zato se je ptička odločila, da jo poišče. Ni še letela dolgo, ko je srečala psa. Ta je srečal klobaso, si jo vzel za svojo in jo seveda pogoltnil. Ptička se je psu pritožila in ga obtožila kraje, ampak vse, kar je rekla je bilo zaman, saj ji je pes odgovoril, da nima nobenih pravic do klobase, ker jo je našel in zato je njena usoda v njegovih tačkah.

Pobrala je les in nesrečna odletela domov. Povedala je mišku vse, kar je videla in slišala. Oba sta bila zelo nesrečna, a vendar sta se dogovorila, da bosta iz tega potegnila najbolje, kar lahko in vseeno ostala sostanovalca.

Tako je ptička pripravljala mizo, mišek je pazil na hrano in si le želel, da bi jo lahko pripravil tako dobro kot je to znala klobasa, ko se je pomešala med zelenjavo, jo solila in namastila, Tako je tudi sam skočil v lonec, a še preden je dosegel njegovo dno, se je poslovil od svojega kožuščka. Od takrat naprej mu dlake nikoli več niso zrasle.

Ptička je prišla, da bi postregla hrano, a kuharja ni bilo nikjer. V paniki je odvrgla les povsod po tleh in klicala naokoli, iskala, ampak kuharja ni bilo nikjer. Prestrašen, opečen mišek je bil že daleč, daleč stran. Kar na lepem pa je les, odvržen povsod okoli, zagorel. Ptička se je trudila, da bi ga pogasila, a ji je vedro padlo v vodnjak. Hiša je za vedno zgorela. Ptiček je prestrašeno odfrčal stran in z miškom se nikoli več nista srečala.",614
6,LITTLE RED-CAP [LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD],"Once upon a time there was a dear little girl who was loved by everyone
who looked at her, but most of all by her grandmother, and there was
nothing that she would not have given to the child. Once she gave her a
little cap of red velvet, which suited her so well that she would never
wear anything else; so she was always called ‘Little Red-Cap.’

One day her mother said to her: ‘Come, Little Red-Cap, here is a piece
of cake and a bottle of wine; take them to your grandmother, she is ill
and weak, and they will do her good. Set out before it gets hot, and
when you are going, walk nicely and quietly and do not run off the path,
or you may fall and break the bottle, and then your grandmother will
get nothing; and when you go into her room, don’t forget to say, “Good
morning”, and don’t peep into every corner before you do it.’

‘I will take great care,’ said Little Red-Cap to her mother, and gave
her hand on it.

The grandmother lived out in the wood, half a league from the village,
and just as Little Red-Cap entered the wood, a wolf met her. Red-Cap
did not know what a wicked creature he was, and was not at all afraid of
him.

‘Good day, Little Red-Cap,’ said he.

‘Thank you kindly, wolf.’

‘Whither away so early, Little Red-Cap?’

‘To my grandmother’s.’

‘What have you got in your apron?’

‘Cake and wine; yesterday was baking-day, so poor sick grandmother is to
have something good, to make her stronger.’

‘Where does your grandmother live, Little Red-Cap?’

‘A good quarter of a league farther on in the wood; her house stands
under the three large oak-trees, the nut-trees are just below; you
surely must know it,’ replied Little Red-Cap.

The wolf thought to himself: ‘What a tender young creature! what a nice
plump mouthful--she will be better to eat than the old woman. I must
act craftily, so as to catch both.’ So he walked for a short time by
the side of Little Red-Cap, and then he said: ‘See, Little Red-Cap, how
pretty the flowers are about here--why do you not look round? I believe,
too, that you do not hear how sweetly the little birds are singing; you
walk gravely along as if you were going to school, while everything else
out here in the wood is merry.’

Little Red-Cap raised her eyes, and when she saw the sunbeams dancing
here and there through the trees, and pretty flowers growing everywhere,
she thought: ‘Suppose I take grandmother a fresh nosegay; that would
please her too. It is so early in the day that I shall still get there
in good time’; and so she ran from the path into the wood to look for
flowers. And whenever she had picked one, she fancied that she saw a
still prettier one farther on, and ran after it, and so got deeper and
deeper into the wood.

Meanwhile the wolf ran straight to the grandmother’s house and knocked
at the door.

‘Who is there?’

‘Little Red-Cap,’ replied the wolf. ‘She is bringing cake and wine; open
the door.’

‘Lift the latch,’ called out the grandmother, ‘I am too weak, and cannot
get up.’

The wolf lifted the latch, the door sprang open, and without saying a
word he went straight to the grandmother’s bed, and devoured her. Then
he put on her clothes, dressed himself in her cap laid himself in bed
and drew the curtains.

Little Red-Cap, however, had been running about picking flowers,
and when she had gathered so many that she could carry no more, she
remembered her grandmother, and set out on the way to her.

She was surprised to find the cottage-door standing open, and when she
went into the room, she had such a strange feeling that she said to
herself: ‘Oh dear! how uneasy I feel today, and at other times I like
being with grandmother so much.’ She called out: ‘Good morning,’ but
received no answer; so she went to the bed and drew back the curtains.
There lay her grandmother with her cap pulled far over her face, and
looking very strange.

‘Oh! grandmother,’ she said, ‘what big ears you have!’

‘The better to hear you with, my child,’ was the reply.

‘But, grandmother, what big eyes you have!’ she said.

‘The better to see you with, my dear.’

‘But, grandmother, what large hands you have!’

‘The better to hug you with.’

‘Oh! but, grandmother, what a terrible big mouth you have!’

‘The better to eat you with!’

And scarcely had the wolf said this, than with one bound he was out of
bed and swallowed up Red-Cap.

When the wolf had appeased his appetite, he lay down again in the bed,
fell asleep and began to snore very loud. The huntsman was just passing
the house, and thought to himself: ‘How the old woman is snoring! I must
just see if she wants anything.’ So he went into the room, and when he
came to the bed, he saw that the wolf was lying in it. ‘Do I find you
here, you old sinner!’ said he. ‘I have long sought you!’ Then just as
he was going to fire at him, it occurred to him that the wolf might have
devoured the grandmother, and that she might still be saved, so he did
not fire, but took a pair of scissors, and began to cut open the stomach
of the sleeping wolf. When he had made two snips, he saw the little
Red-Cap shining, and then he made two snips more, and the little girl
sprang out, crying: ‘Ah, how frightened I have been! How dark it was
inside the wolf’; and after that the aged grandmother came out alive
also, but scarcely able to breathe. Red-Cap, however, quickly fetched
great stones with which they filled the wolf’s belly, and when he awoke,
he wanted to run away, but the stones were so heavy that he collapsed at
once, and fell dead.

Then all three were delighted. The huntsman drew off the wolf’s skin and
went home with it; the grandmother ate the cake and drank the wine which
Red-Cap had brought, and revived, but Red-Cap thought to herself: ‘As
long as I live, I will never by myself leave the path, to run into the
wood, when my mother has forbidden me to do so.’",1118,rdeca kapica,"Mama je poklicala Rdečo kapico in ji rekla: “Babica je bolna. Pripravila sem košaro z dobrotami. Prosim, odnesi jo babici.” Nato ji je še rekla: “Pazi kje hodiš! Ne hodi po gozdnih poteh, da ne srečaš volka!” Redeča kapica ji je obljubila, da bo previdna, vzela košarico in šla po cesti k babici. Med potjo pa je pozabila na obljubo. Zagledala je lepe rože, ko so rastle v gozdu. Mislila si je, da bo bolna babica prav gotovo vesela šopka lepih rož, zato je zavila v gozd, da bi nabrala lepe cvetlice. Na skrivaj pa jo je opazoval volk in takoj je pristopil k Rdeči kapici. Ogovoril jo je: “Dober dan Rdeča kapica. Kaj pa delaš sama v gozdu? Kam si namenjena?” Rdeča kapica ni poznala hudobnega volka in se ga ni prestrašila. Odgovorila mu je: “Grem k bolni babici. Mama je pripravila košaro dobrot, da se bo malo okrepčala.” Volk jo je še povprašal kje živi njena babica nato pa že skoval načrt kako bo najprej pojedel babico in nato še Rdečo kapico. Rdeči kapici pa je še rekel: “Če je babica bolna, ji bodo prav gotovo teknile sladke borovnice. Vem, kje rastejo najdebelejše. Pokazal ti bom.

Kmalu je prišla Rdeča kapica in položila košaro dobrot na mizo. Ko je zagledala babico ležati v postelji, se ji je zazdela tako čudna. Vprašala jo je: “Babica, zakaj imaš tako velika ušesa?” In volk ji je odgovoril:” Da bi te bolje slišalaZakaj pa imaš tako velike oči?” In volk je odgovoril: “Da bi te bolje videla.” Nato je še vprašala: “Zakaj pa imaš tako velike roke?” In volk je odgovoril: “Da te lažje objamem.” “Ampak babica, zakaj pa imaš tako velika usta?” In volk je odgovoril:

In tako je volk požrl še Rdečo kapico. Ker je bil tako utrujen in sit se je ulegel nazaj v babičino posteljo in zaspal. Glasno je smrčal in slišal ga je lovec, ki je šel mimo babičine hiše. Pogledal je v hišo ali je z babico vse v redu, takrat pa je zagledal volka, ki je ležal v babičini postelji. Pomislil je, da je najbrž požrl babico, zato je vzel oster nož in spečemu volku prerezal trebuh. Iz trebuha je najprej skočila Rdeča kapica, nato pa še babica. Obe sta bili živi in zdravi. Skupaj so volku napolnili trebuh s težkimi kamni in ga zašili nazaj. Ko se je volk prebudil, je bil zalo žejen. Odpravil se je do bližnjega vodnjaka, da bi pil vodo, a ko se je sklonil je padel vanj in umrl.

Babica, Rdeča kapica in lovec so se skupaj veselili, da so premagali hudobnega volka. Pogostili so se z dobrotami, ki jih je pripravila mama v košarici. Rdeča kapica pa je vsem še enkrat obljubila, da prav zares nikoli več ne bo skrenila iz glavne poti.

7,RUMPELSTILTSKIN,"By the side of a wood, in a country a long way off, ran a fine stream
of water; and upon the stream there stood a mill. The miller’s house was
close by, and the miller, you must know, had a very beautiful daughter.
She was, moreover, very shrewd and clever; and the miller was so proud
of her, that he one day told the king of the land, who used to come and
hunt in the wood, that his daughter could spin gold out of straw. Now
this king was very fond of money; and when he heard the miller’s boast
his greediness was raised, and he sent for the girl to be brought before
him. Then he led her to a chamber in his palace where there was a great
heap of straw, and gave her a spinning-wheel, and said, ‘All this must
be spun into gold before morning, as you love your life.’ It was in vain
that the poor maiden said that it was only a silly boast of her father,
for that she could do no such thing as spin straw into gold: the chamber
door was locked, and she was left alone.

She sat down in one corner of the room, and began to bewail her hard
fate; when on a sudden the door opened, and a droll-looking little man
hobbled in, and said, ‘Good morrow to you, my good lass; what are you
weeping for?’ ‘Alas!’ said she, ‘I must spin this straw into gold, and
I know not how.’ ‘What will you give me,’ said the hobgoblin, ‘to do it
for you?’ ‘My necklace,’ replied the maiden. He took her at her word,
and sat himself down to the wheel, and whistled and sang:

 ‘Round about, round about,
    Lo and behold!
  Reel away, reel away,
    Straw into gold!’

And round about the wheel went merrily; the work was quickly done, and
the straw was all spun into gold.

When the king came and saw this, he was greatly astonished and pleased;
but his heart grew still more greedy of gain, and he shut up the poor
miller’s daughter again with a fresh task. Then she knew not what to do,
and sat down once more to weep; but the dwarf soon opened the door, and
said, ‘What will you give me to do your task?’ ‘The ring on my finger,’
said she. So her little friend took the ring, and began to work at the
wheel again, and whistled and sang:

 ‘Round about, round about,
    Lo and behold!
  Reel away, reel away,
    Straw into gold!’

till, long before morning, all was done again.

The king was greatly delighted to see all this glittering treasure;
but still he had not enough: so he took the miller’s daughter to a yet
larger heap, and said, ‘All this must be spun tonight; and if it is,
you shall be my queen.’ As soon as she was alone that dwarf came in, and
said, ‘What will you give me to spin gold for you this third time?’
‘I have nothing left,’ said she. ‘Then say you will give me,’ said
the little man, ‘the first little child that you may have when you are
queen.’ ‘That may never be,’ thought the miller’s daughter: and as she
knew no other way to get her task done, she said she would do what he
asked. Round went the wheel again to the old song, and the manikin once
more spun the heap into gold. The king came in the morning, and, finding
all he wanted, was forced to keep his word; so he married the miller’s
daughter, and she really became queen.

At the birth of her first little child she was very glad, and forgot the
dwarf, and what she had said. But one day he came into her room, where
she was sitting playing with her baby, and put her in mind of it. Then
she grieved sorely at her misfortune, and said she would give him all
the wealth of the kingdom if he would let her off, but in vain; till at
last her tears softened him, and he said, ‘I will give you three days’
grace, and if during that time you tell me my name, you shall keep your
child.’

Now the queen lay awake all night, thinking of all the odd names that
she had ever heard; and she sent messengers all over the land to find
out new ones. The next day the little man came, and she began with
TIMOTHY, ICHABOD, BENJAMIN, JEREMIAH, and all the names she could
remember; but to all and each of them he said, ‘Madam, that is not my
name.’

The second day she began with all the comical names she could hear of,
BANDY-LEGS, HUNCHBACK, CROOK-SHANKS, and so on; but the little gentleman
still said to every one of them, ‘Madam, that is not my name.’

The third day one of the messengers came back, and said, ‘I have
travelled two days without hearing of any other names; but yesterday, as
I was climbing a high hill, among the trees of the forest where the fox
and the hare bid each other good night, I saw a little hut; and before
the hut burnt a fire; and round about the fire a funny little dwarf was
dancing upon one leg, and singing:

 “Merrily the feast I’ll make.
  Today I’ll brew, tomorrow bake;
  Merrily I’ll dance and sing,
  For next day will a stranger bring.
  Little does my lady dream
  Rumpelstiltskin is my name!”

When the queen heard this she jumped for joy, and as soon as her little
friend came she sat down upon her throne, and called all her court round
to enjoy the fun; and the nurse stood by her side with the baby in her
arms, as if it was quite ready to be given up. Then the little man began
to chuckle at the thought of having the poor child, to take home with
him to his hut in the woods; and he cried out, ‘Now, lady, what is my
name?’ ‘Is it JOHN?’ asked she. ‘No, madam!’ ‘Is it TOM?’ ‘No, madam!’
‘Is it JEMMY?’ ‘It is not.’ ‘Can your name be ?’ said the
lady slyly. ‘Some witch told you that!--some witch told you that!’ cried
the little man, and dashed his right foot in a rage so deep into the
floor, that he was forced to lay hold of it with both hands to pull it
out.

Then he made the best of his way off, while the nurse laughed and the
baby crowed; and all the court jeered at him for having had so much
trouble for nothing, and said, ‘We wish you a very good morning, and a
merry feast, Mr RUMPLESTILTSKIN!’",1151,spicparkeljc,"Nekoč reven je mlinar v kraljestvu živel, zelo lepo hčerko on je imel. Zgodilo se je, da mu šlo je za preživetje, zato stopil je pred kralja in si skušal rešit življenje. Rekel je kralju, pobahal se mu, “hči moja je predilja, iz slame sprede vam zlato.”

Kralju zasvetile so se oči “pripelji mi hčerko, tu ostane preko noči, da dokaže, če res vredno je znanje moje krvi.”

Dekle so privedli pred kralja in jo odpeljali v sobo precej polno slame, dali so ji kolovrat in vreteno in rekli “Loti se dela, če do jutra ne spredeš te slame v zlato, boš morala plačati s svojim življenjem.”

Tako je sam kralj sobo zaklenil in pustil dekle v samoti. Uboga mlinarjeva hči ni vedela, kaj naj stori, ni vedela, kako se slamo lahko v zlato spremeni in vedno bolj jo je skrbelo, da ne bo več dočakala kaj dosti dni, tako ji je od vsega hudega po licu spolzela solzica.

In tako na lepem vrata se odpro in skoznje pristopical je mali možiček, postavil se pred njo: “Dober večer, mlinarjeva gospodična, zakaj jočete tako?”

“Vidiš” rekla je gospodična “spresti moram slamo v zlato in ne vem, kako.”

“Kaj mi daš” je rekel možic “če jaz to zate storil bi?”

“Dala bi ti svojo ogrlico” rekla je mlinarjeva hči.

Možic ogrlico je vzel, se posedel pred kolovrat in ga zavrtel, vroom, vroom, vroom, trije obrati in vreteno svetlikalo se je v barvi zlati, potem lotil se dela je spet, vroom, vroom, vroom, ga trikrat zavrtel in dosegel zlati lesk. Vrtel ga je vse tja do jutra, dokler vse slame spredel ni in vsa vretena napolnil z zlatom, ki svetilo se je v jutranji temi.

Ko vzšlo je sonce, je kralj že prišel in presenečeno zrl nad zlatom, ki ga je našel, njegovo pohlepno srce pa ni imelo dovolj. Mlinarjevo hči odpeljal je v drugo sobo polno slame, bilo je slame še veliko več in če ji je bilo kaj do življenja spet do jutra morala je kolovrat vrtet. Dekle ni vedelo, kaj ji je storiti, zato je jokala in vrata so zopet se odprla z malim možicem med njimi “Kaj dala mi boš tokrat, da slamo spremenim v zlate niti?”
“Prstan, ki se bohoti mi na prstu,” reklo je dekle.

Mali mož vzel je prstan in zavrtel je staro kolo, do jutra spremenil vso slamo je zopet v svetlikajoče se zlato.

Kralj navdušen nad obsegom zlata, še vedno ni zadovoljil željo svojega srca in zopet odpeljal je mlinarjevo hči v sobo kjer slame je bilo za tri noči: “Tudi to slamo v zlato čez noč spremeni, če uspe ti, pa takrat s tabo kralj se oženi.”

Čeravno bila je le mlinarjeva hči, menil je, da je bogatejše nikoli ne dobi.

Ko ostala je sama, je možic spet prišel in rekel ji je:”Kaj daš mi, dekle, da bom kolovrat zavrtel?”

“Ničesar več nimam, kar dala bi ti,” odgovori dekle in zajoče v dlani.

“Potem pa mi obljubi, če postala boš kraljica, da prvorojenec bo moja pravica.”

Mlinarjeva hči niti vedela ni, če res s kraljem se na koncu omoži, zato zavoljo lastnega življenja, obljubila je možicu pravico do otroka in odstopila pot mu do prvega vretena, tako spet slamo preko noči mali možic v zlato spremeni.

In ko tako se kralj vrnil je zjutraj in našel tisto, kar si želelo je njegovo srce, poročil je dekle in kraljico napravil iz nje.

Po letu dni se čudovit otrok ji rodi, pozabila je, kaj mali možic si želi. In tako, kar iz nič je stopil pred njo: “Izpolni obljubo, ki si jo dala za zlato.”

Kraljica se stresla je od silne groze, možicu ponudila bogastvo je in pol. Če le pustil bi otroka v njenem naročju, bi odnesel vse, kar v lasti kralj je imel. A možic se ni dal: “Nekaj živega je vredno več kot bogastvo vsega sveta.”

Kraljica je jokala in na kolenih prosila, smilila se je možicu, tako ga je ganila.

“Dam ti nič več kot tri dni časa,” je rekel možic “da moje ime v teh dneh ugotoviš, ako to ti do takrat ne uspe, otrok je moj in nikar ne trudi se.”

Tako kraljica je razmišljala vso noč o imenih, kar jih je čula in trudila se na vso moč, poslala je sla preko širne dežele, da vrnil bi se z imenom, ki bilo bi njegovo. Ko prišel je dan in z njim mali možic,  naštevala je vse od Gašperja, Matjaža, Baltazarja do zadnjega kar jih pozna, a vsakemu sledil je odgovor: “Glej, imena mojega ona ne ve” in možic zadovoljno nasmihal se je.

Drugi dan je imela seznam imen vseh čudnih sosednjih kraljevin, bolj bila so nenavadna, bolj verjetno se ji je zdelo, da pravi končno med njimi tiči. Tako možicu malemu je brala Malireberc, Ovčjerepec, Bolhonogec in odgovor, ki sledi ostajal je enak: “Ne, tako pa ime meni ni.”

Tretji dan se vrnil je vdan vitez na konju in rekel ji je: “Imena vam novega žal ne prinašam, a ko sem se bližal visokim goram, ob koncu gozda zagledal sem konja, poleg pa ogenj in hišico malo, okoli ognja je plesal prav smešno majhen možic in pel si je pesem, nekako takole:

Danes bom pekel, jutri varil,
naslednji dan kraljevega otroka dobil,
oh, kako v zadovoljstvo mi je,
ko nihče ne ve, da mi Špicparkeljc je ime.”

Lahko si le mislite kako vesela bila je kraljica ob imenu novem, ki ga slišala je. In kmalu mali možic pojavi se v sobi in zopet jo vpraša: “Draga kraljica, kako mi je ime?”

Sprva mu reče “Je Cene tvoje ime?”

“Ne.”

“Mogoče si Jani?”

“Ne.”

“Mogoče pa je tvoje ime Špicparkeljc?”

“To ti povedal sam je hudič! To ti povedal sam je hudič!” Zajokal mali je možic in v svojem besu z desno nogo ob tla udaril tako močno, da potegnilo mu nogo je v zemljo. Ko jo je hotel izvleči, se razklal je na pol in končal coprnijo, otrok zdaj nikoli ne bo njegov.",996
8,ASHPUTTEL,"The wife of a rich man fell sick; and when she felt that her end drew
nigh, she called her only daughter to her bed-side, and said, ‘Always be
a good girl, and I will look down from heaven and watch over you.’ Soon
afterwards she shut her eyes and died, and was buried in the garden;
and the little girl went every day to her grave and wept, and was always
good and kind to all about her. And the snow fell and spread a beautiful
white covering over the grave; but by the time the spring came, and the
sun had melted it away again, her father had married another wife. This
new wife had two daughters of her own, that she brought home with her;
they were fair in face but foul at heart, and it was now a sorry time
for the poor little girl. ‘What does the good-for-nothing want in the
parlour?’ said they; ‘they who would eat bread should first earn it;
away with the kitchen-maid!’ Then they took away her fine clothes, and
gave her an old grey frock to put on, and laughed at her, and turned her
into the kitchen.

There she was forced to do hard work; to rise early before daylight, to
bring the water, to make the fire, to cook and to wash. Besides that,
the sisters plagued her in all sorts of ways, and laughed at her. In the
evening when she was tired, she had no bed to lie down on, but was made
to lie by the hearth among the ashes; and as this, of course, made her
always dusty and dirty, they called her Ashputtel.

It happened once that the father was going to the fair, and asked his
wife’s daughters what he should bring them. ‘Fine clothes,’ said the
first; ‘Pearls and diamonds,’ cried the second. ‘Now, child,’ said he
to his own daughter, ‘what will you have?’ ‘The first twig, dear
father, that brushes against your hat when you turn your face to come
homewards,’ said she. Then he bought for the first two the fine clothes
and pearls and diamonds they had asked for: and on his way home, as he
rode through a green copse, a hazel twig brushed against him, and almost
pushed off his hat: so he broke it off and brought it away; and when he
got home he gave it to his daughter. Then she took it, and went to
her mother’s grave and planted it there; and cried so much that it was
watered with her tears; and there it grew and became a fine tree. Three
times every day she went to it and cried; and soon a little bird came
and built its nest upon the tree, and talked with her, and watched over
her, and brought her whatever she wished for.

Now it happened that the king of that land held a feast, which was to
last three days; and out of those who came to it his son was to choose
a bride for himself. Ashputtel’s two sisters were asked to come; so they
called her up, and said, ‘Now, comb our hair, brush our shoes, and tie
our sashes for us, for we are going to dance at the king’s feast.’
Then she did as she was told; but when all was done she could not help
crying, for she thought to herself, she should so have liked to have
gone with them to the ball; and at last she begged her mother very hard
to let her go. ‘You, Ashputtel!’ said she; ‘you who have nothing to
wear, no clothes at all, and who cannot even dance--you want to go to
the ball? And when she kept on begging, she said at last, to get rid of
her, ‘I will throw this dishful of peas into the ash-heap, and if in
two hours’ time you have picked them all out, you shall go to the feast
too.’

Then she threw the peas down among the ashes, but the little maiden ran
out at the back door into the garden, and cried out:

 ‘Hither, hither, through the sky,
  Turtle-doves and linnets, fly!
  Blackbird, thrush, and chaffinch gay,
  Hither, hither, haste away!
  One and all come help me, quick!
  Haste ye, haste ye!--pick, pick, pick!’

Then first came two white doves, flying in at the kitchen window; next
came two turtle-doves; and after them came all the little birds under
heaven, chirping and fluttering in: and they flew down into the ashes.
And the little doves stooped their heads down and set to work, pick,
pick, pick; and then the others began to pick, pick, pick: and among
them all they soon picked out all the good grain, and put it into a dish
but left the ashes. Long before the end of the hour the work was quite
done, and all flew out again at the windows.

Then Ashputtel brought the dish to her mother, overjoyed at the thought
that now she should go to the ball. But the mother said, ‘No, no! you
slut, you have no clothes, and cannot dance; you shall not go.’ And when
Ashputtel begged very hard to go, she said, ‘If you can in one hour’s
time pick two of those dishes of peas out of the ashes, you shall go
too.’ And thus she thought she should at least get rid of her. So she
shook two dishes of peas into the ashes.

But the little maiden went out into the garden at the back of the house,
and cried out as before:

 ‘Hither, hither, through the sky,
  Turtle-doves and linnets, fly!
  Blackbird, thrush, and chaffinch gay,
  Hither, hither, haste away!
  One and all come help me, quick!
  Haste ye, haste ye!--pick, pick, pick!’

Then first came two white doves in at the kitchen window; next came two
turtle-doves; and after them came all the little birds under heaven,
chirping and hopping about. And they flew down into the ashes; and the
little doves put their heads down and set to work, pick, pick, pick; and
then the others began pick, pick, pick; and they put all the good grain
into the dishes, and left all the ashes. Before half an hour’s time all
was done, and out they flew again. And then Ashputtel took the dishes to
her mother, rejoicing to think that she should now go to the ball.
But her mother said, ‘It is all of no use, you cannot go; you have no
clothes, and cannot dance, and you would only put us to shame’: and off
she went with her two daughters to the ball.

Now when all were gone, and nobody left at home, Ashputtel went
sorrowfully and sat down under the hazel-tree, and cried out:

 ‘Shake, shake, hazel-tree,
  Gold and silver over me!’

Then her friend the bird flew out of the tree, and brought a gold and
silver dress for her, and slippers of spangled silk; and she put them
on, and followed her sisters to the feast. But they did not know her,
and thought it must be some strange princess, she looked so fine and
beautiful in her rich clothes; and they never once thought of Ashputtel,
taking it for granted that she was safe at home in the dirt.

The king’s son soon came up to her, and took her by the hand and danced
with her, and no one else: and he never left her hand; but when anyone
else came to ask her to dance, he said, ‘This lady is dancing with me.’

Thus they danced till a late hour of the night; and then she wanted to
go home: and the king’s son said, ‘I shall go and take care of you to
your home’; for he wanted to see where the beautiful maiden lived. But
she slipped away from him, unawares, and ran off towards home; and as
the prince followed her, she jumped up into the pigeon-house and shut
the door. Then he waited till her father came home, and told him that
the unknown maiden, who had been at the feast, had hid herself in the
pigeon-house. But when they had broken open the door they found no one
within; and as they came back into the house, Ashputtel was lying, as
she always did, in her dirty frock by the ashes, and her dim little
lamp was burning in the chimney. For she had run as quickly as she could
through the pigeon-house and on to the hazel-tree, and had there taken
off her beautiful clothes, and put them beneath the tree, that the bird
might carry them away, and had lain down again amid the ashes in her
little grey frock.

The next day when the feast was again held, and her father, mother, and
sisters were gone, Ashputtel went to the hazel-tree, and said:

 ‘Shake, shake, hazel-tree,
  Gold and silver over me!’

And the bird came and brought a still finer dress than the one she
had worn the day before. And when she came in it to the ball, everyone
wondered at her beauty: but the king’s son, who was waiting for her,
took her by the hand, and danced with her; and when anyone asked her to
dance, he said as before, ‘This lady is dancing with me.’

When night came she wanted to go home; and the king’s son followed here
as before, that he might see into what house she went: but she sprang
away from him all at once into the garden behind her father’s house.
In this garden stood a fine large pear-tree full of ripe fruit; and
Ashputtel, not knowing where to hide herself, jumped up into it without
being seen. Then the king’s son lost sight of her, and could not find
out where she was gone, but waited till her father came home, and said
to him, ‘The unknown lady who danced with me has slipped away, and I
think she must have sprung into the pear-tree.’ The father thought to
himself, ‘Can it be Ashputtel?’ So he had an axe brought; and they cut
down the tree, but found no one upon it. And when they came back into
the kitchen, there lay Ashputtel among the ashes; for she had slipped
down on the other side of the tree, and carried her beautiful clothes
back to the bird at the hazel-tree, and then put on her little grey
frock.

The third day, when her father and mother and sisters were gone, she
went again into the garden, and said:

 ‘Shake, shake, hazel-tree,
  Gold and silver over me!’

Then her kind friend the bird brought a dress still finer than the
former one, and slippers which were all of gold: so that when she came
to the feast no one knew what to say, for wonder at her beauty: and the
king’s son danced with nobody but her; and when anyone else asked her to
dance, he said, ‘This lady is _my_ partner, sir.’

When night came she wanted to go home; and the king’s son would go with
her, and said to himself, ‘I will not lose her this time’; but, however,
she again slipped away from him, though in such a hurry that she dropped
her left golden slipper upon the stairs.

The prince took the shoe, and went the next day to the king his father,
and said, ‘I will take for my wife the lady that this golden slipper
fits.’ Then both the sisters were overjoyed to hear it; for they
had beautiful feet, and had no doubt that they could wear the golden
slipper. The eldest went first into the room where the slipper was, and
wanted to try it on, and the mother stood by. But her great toe could
not go into it, and the shoe was altogether much too small for her. Then
the mother gave her a knife, and said, ‘Never mind, cut it off; when you
are queen you will not care about toes; you will not want to walk.’ So
the silly girl cut off her great toe, and thus squeezed on the shoe,
and went to the king’s son. Then he took her for his bride, and set her
beside him on his horse, and rode away with her homewards.

But on their way home they had to pass by the hazel-tree that Ashputtel
had planted; and on the branch sat a little dove singing:

 ‘Back again! back again! look to the shoe!
  The shoe is too small, and not made for you!
  Prince! prince! look again for thy bride,
  For she’s not the true one that sits by thy side.’

Then the prince got down and looked at her foot; and he saw, by the
blood that streamed from it, what a trick she had played him. So he
turned his horse round, and brought the false bride back to her home,
and said, ‘This is not the right bride; let the other sister try and put
on the slipper.’ Then she went into the room and got her foot into the
shoe, all but the heel, which was too large. But her mother squeezed it
in till the blood came, and took her to the king’s son: and he set her
as his bride by his side on his horse, and rode away with her.

But when they came to the hazel-tree the little dove sat there still,
and sang:

 ‘Back again! back again! look to the shoe!
  The shoe is too small, and not made for you!
  Prince! prince! look again for thy bride,
  For she’s not the true one that sits by thy side.’

Then he looked down, and saw that the blood streamed so much from the
shoe, that her white stockings were quite red. So he turned his horse
and brought her also back again. ‘This is not the true bride,’ said he
to the father; ‘have you no other daughters?’ ‘No,’ said he; ‘there is
only a little dirty Ashputtel here, the child of my first wife; I am
sure she cannot be the bride.’ The prince told him to send her. But the
mother said, ‘No, no, she is much too dirty; she will not dare to show
herself.’ However, the prince would have her come; and she first washed
her face and hands, and then went in and curtsied to him, and he reached
her the golden slipper. Then she took her clumsy shoe off her left foot,
and put on the golden slipper; and it fitted her as if it had been made
for her. And when he drew near and looked at her face he knew her, and
said, ‘This is the right bride.’ But the mother and both the sisters
were frightened, and turned pale with anger as he took Ashputtel on his
horse, and rode away with her. And when they came to the hazel-tree, the
white dove sang:

 ‘Home! home! look at the shoe!
  Princess! the shoe was made for you!
  Prince! prince! take home thy bride,
  For she is the true one that sits by thy side!’

And when the dove had done its song, it came flying, and perched upon
her right shoulder, and so went home with her.",2608,pepelka,"Nekoč sta živela mož in žena, ki sta imela ljubko ter nadvse prijazno hčer. Bili so srečna družina, dokler ni žena zbolela in umrla.

Čez čas se je ovdoveli mož odločil znova poročiti. Za drugo ženo si je izbral vdovo, ki je že iz prejšnjega zakona imela dve hčeri. To je bila ošabna ženska, hitre jeze ter pokvarjenega značaja. Njeni hčeri, ki sta bili sicer lepi, sta ji bili po značaju nadvse podobni.

Takoj po poroki je mačeha začela kazati svoj pravi obraz. Ni dobro prenašala vrlin svoje pastorke, saj so bile ob njej njene hčere videti zahrbtne ter hinavske.

Pastorki je zato nalagala najtežja in najbolj umazana dela, med drugim tudi čiščenje dimnika. Ker je bilo dekle pogosto vso črno od saj, se jo je prijel vzdevek Pepelka. A umazanim oblekam navkljub je svoji novi sestri stokrat prekašala po lepoti. Tega ji seveda nista pozabili zameriti.

Pepelka je morala vsak dan trdo delati. Medtem ko sta njeni sestri čez dan uživali v brezdelju, ponoči pa udobno spali v velikih posteljah s svileno posteljnino, je morala ona čez dan garati, noči pa preživljati na odsluženi žimnici v mrzli podstrešni sobi.

Kljub vsemu je potrpežljivo prenašala vse tegobe, niti očetu se ni potožila. Slednji je bil veliko zdoma, zato mu ni hotela delati še dodatnih skrbi.

Nekega dne se je po kraljestvu razširil glas o kraljevem plesu, na katerega so bila povabljena najlepša dekleta v deželi. Kraljev sin, postaven princ, si bo na plesu izbral nevesto.

Med povabljenimi sta bili tudi Pepelkini sestri, saj je imela njuna mati kar nekaj poznanstev iz plemiških vrst. Bili sta tako navdušeni, da se v hiši ni govorilo o ničemer drugem kot o plesu. To je pomenilo še več dela za ubogo Pepelko, saj jima je morala od spredaj in zadaj streči, medtem ko sta se po cele dneve lišpali ter pomerjali obleke.

Vmes pa nista pozabili zbadati Pepelke.

""Pepelka, bi rada šla na ples?""

""Seveda,"" je odgovorila Pepelka, ki so se ji ob sami misli na to zaiskrile oči.

""Se bomo pozanimali, če potrebujejo koga za čiščenje dimnika, vendar se mi zdi, da si tudi za to preslabo oblečena.""

Vse dni, ko sta se pripravljali na ples, sta jo tako zbadali in zasmehovali. Pepelka je še naprej pridno opravljala svoje naloge, a v srcu jo je zelo bolelo, da ne more na ples.

Naposled je prišel dolgo pričakovani dan. Mačeha in sestri so se s kočijo odpeljale proti dvoru, Pepelka pa je potrta gledala za njimi. Ko jih ni več videla, je bridko zajokala.

Vso v solzah jo je našla dobra vila, ki jo je obiskala na prošnjo pokojne matere.

""Kaj je narobe?"" je vprašala.

""Rada bi ... rada bi,"" je ihtela Pepelka, tako vznemirjena, da ni mogla niti stavka dokončati.

""Rada bi šla na ples, mar ne?"" ji je pomagala dobra vila.

""Da,"" je zavzdihnila Pepelka.

""No, dobro,"" je rekla vila. ""Mislim, da ti lahko pomagam."" Malo je pomislila, potem pa rekla: ""Pojdi na vrt in mi prinesi bučo.""

Pepelka je poiskala največjo bučo. Odnesla jo je k vili, vmes pa razmišljala, kako neki ji bo buča pomagala priti na ples.

Vila je z nožičem mojstrsko izvotlila bučo, nato pa zamahnila s svojo čarobno palico in glej - buča se je spremenila v razkošno kočijo.

Potem je poiskala mišnico, v kateri je našla šest mišk. Pepelki je naročila, naj dvigne vratca in jih počasi, eno po eno, spušča na prostost. Vsake miške se je dotaknila s čarobno palico, kar jih je preobrazilo v šest sivih konjičev.

Zdaj je bilo treba poskrbeti še za kočijaža.

""Grem pogledat,"" je rekla Pepelka, ""če se je v past ujela tudi kakšna podgana.""

""Seveda,"" je odvrnila vila, ""podgana bo dober kočijaž.""

Pepelka je prinesla past, v kateri so bile tri velike podgane. Vila je izbrala tisto z najbolj elegantnimi brki. Zamahnila je s čarobno palico in podgana se je spremenila v debelušnega kočijaža z najlepšimi brki v deželi.

""Tako, prevozno sredstvo je nared,"" je rekla vila, vidno ponosna na svoje delo. ""Si zadovoljna?""

""Oh, seveda,"" je odvrnila Pepelka, ""ampak na ples kljub temu ne morem v teh umazanih cunjah.""

""Ah,"" je rekla vila, ""to pa res ni problem."" S čarobno palico se je le dotaknila Pepelke in v trenutku se je dekle znašlo v prelepi obleki, okrašeni s čudovitimi dragulji. Potem ji je podarila še par krasnih steklenih čeveljcev in bila je nared za ples.

Preden jo je kočija odpeljala, jo je še opozorila, da mora ples zapustiti pred polnočjo. Takrat bo namreč čarovnija izgubila svojo moč in njena kočija se bo ponovno spremenila v bučo, konji v miši, kočijaž v podgano in čudovita obleka v razdrapane cunje.

Obljubila je, da bo odšla s plesa, še preden ura odbije dvanajst. Potem se je zahvalila in že je kočijaž pognal konje proti dvoru.

Že sam Pepelkin prihod je vzbudil veliko zanimanja. Vsi so se spraševali, kdo je čudovita princesa, ki je nihče ne pozna. Sam kraljevič jo je prišel pospremit v plesno dvorano in ko sta vstopila, je vse utihnilo. Plesalci so se ustavili, violine so prenehale igrati, vsi so strmeli v lepoto neznane gostje.

Tudi sam kralj ni mogel umakniti pogleda z nje. ""Že dolgo nisem videl tako očarljive lepotice,"" je zašepetal kraljici.

Vse dame so skrbno pregledovale Pepelkino obleko, da bi se lahko naslednji dan tudi one pojavile v podobno čudoviti opravi. Seveda, če bodo uspele najti ustrezen material in dovolj sposobne krojače.

Kraljevič je Pepelko posedel na častno mesto blizu kraljeve družine in jo takoj prosil za ples. Vse oči so bile uzrte v lep mlad par, ki se je z občudujočo milino vrtel po plesišču.

Nato so postregli z veličastno večerjo, ki je teknila vsem razen princu. Ta je bil preveč prevzet nad Pepelko, da bi lahko razmišljal o hrani.

Pepelka se je po večerji nekaj časa družila tudi s svojima sestrama, ki pa je brez sajastih oblačil sploh nista prepoznali.

Večer je minil hitro, kakor se rado zgodi, če se imaš lepo. Ko je bilo pol ure do dvanajst, se je Pepelka prijazno poslovila od družbe in se odpravila domov.

Doma jo je pričakala dobra vila, kateri je hitela navdušeno opisovati čudovit večer. Nato je rekla, da si želi na ples tudi naslednji dan, saj jo je povabil sam kraljev sin.

Kmalu so se s plesa vrnili tudi sestri in mačeha. Pogovarjali so se o skrivnostni princesi, ki je nihče ni poznal in ki je vse očarala, še zlasti kraljeviča. Ta je bil ob njenem odhodu zelo zaskrbljen. Hodil je od gosta do gosta in spraševal, če vedo, kdo je skrivnostna lepotica in od kod se je vzela.

Pepelka je komaj zadrževala navdušenje, ko je to slišala. Vprašala je po imenu te očarljive princese, toda nihče ga ni poznal.

""Verjetno je prišla zelo od daleč,"" je rekla mačeha.

""Mora biti pa res zelo lepa,"" je pripomnila Pepelka, ""da je pustila tako močan vtis. Oh, kako rada bi jo tudi sama videla?""

""Najprej moraš biti povabljena na ples, ti razcapanka!"" ji je zabrusila starejša sestra.

""Ampak, kdo bo povabil takšno strašilo?"" je pridodala mlajša.

A Pepelke zbadanje ni užalostilo. To je bil zanjo prelep večer in jutri bo še en.

Naslednjega večera je bila še čudovitejša kot dan poprej. Princa je popolnoma očarala, cel večer se je sukal samo okoli nje in jo nenehno obmetaval s komplimenti. Tako dobro se je imela, da je čisto pozabila na čas. Ko je prvikrat odbilo za dvanajst, je bila prepričana, da je ura komaj enajst.

Na srečo je še pravočasno ugotovila svojo zmoto in takoj stekla iz dvorane. Princ ji je sledil, vendar je bila prehitra.

Za njo je ostal le stekleni čeveljček, ki ga je izgubila, ko je tekla po stopnicah. Princ ga je nežno pobral ter si ga stisnil k srcu. Nato se je pozanimal pri dvornih vratarjih, ali so videli oditi kakšno princeso, a oni so prisegli, da niso videli nikogar razen kmečkega dekleta v ponošenih oblačilih.

Pepelka je vsa zadihana pritekla domov – brez kočijaža, kočije in konjev, v svojih umazanih cunjah. Od njene čudovite oprave ni ostalo nič drugega kot en steklen čeveljček, ki ga je hitro skrila pod posteljo.

Ko sta se vrnili sestri, ju je vprašala, če je bilo lepo in ali je bila tudi tokrat tam skrivnostna princesa. Povedali sta ji, da je bila prisotna, vendar je ob polnoči zapustila dvorano s takšno naglico, da je izgubila enega od svojih čudovitih steklenih čeveljčkov. Dodali sta, da je princ, ki je čevelj pobral, preostanek večera samo še strmel vanj, iz česar je bilo razvidno, da se je močno zaljubil. Sestri sta govorili resnico, saj je kraljevič res bil do ušes zaljubljen.

Kraljevi glasniki so čez nekaj dni razglasili, da se bo princ poročil z dekletom, katerega stopalo se bo natanko ujemalo z izgubljenim steklenim čeveljčkom. Najprej so dali čevelj pomeriti princesam, groficam ter vsem ostalim dekletom plemiške krvi, a zaman. Vse so imela prevelika stopala.

Potem so bile na vrsti ostale dame, ki so se udeležile plesa. In tako so nekega dne kraljevi odposlanci potrkali tudi na vrata hiše, v kateri je živela Pepelka.

Sestri sta se na vse pretege trudili obuti steklen čeveljček, vendar nikakor ni šlo. Imela sta kar nekaj številk prevelika stopala.

Nato je Pepelka vprašala, ali lahko poskusi tudi ona.

""Glej, glej,"" sta jo začeli zbadati sestri, ""razcapanka hoče biti princesa.""

Kraljevi odposlanec, ki je imel jasna navodila, da mora čevelj pomeriti vsako godno dekle, ji je dovolil. Posedel jo je ter nataknil čeveljček. Vsi so obstali odprtih ust, kajti čevelj je objel stopalo kot ulit. Da bi bilo presenečenje še večje, je Pepelka iz žepa potegnila še drugi čeveljček. Kot da to ne bi bilo dovolj, se je v tistem trenutku pojavila še dobra vila. S čarobno palico se je dotaknila Pepelke in ta se je ponovno znašla v veličastni obleki. Dvomov ni bilo več, Pepelka je bila skrivnostna lepotica.

Sestri sta takoj padli na kolena in začeli prositi odpuščanja za vse, kar sta ji grdega storili. Pepelka - dobrega srca, kot je bila – jima ni zamerila. ""Kar je bilo, je bilo,"" je rekla in ju objela.

Potem so jo odpeljali na dvor. Princu se je zdela lepša kot najlepši dragulj. Takoj sta si padla v objem ter si izpovedala ljubezen. Čez nekaj dni je bila velika poroka.

Tako kot je bila Pepelka lepa, je bila tudi dobra. Ko je postala princesa, ni pozabila svojih sester, kljub temu, da sta se v preteklosti do nje obnašali grdo. Priskrbela jima je prostore na dvoru in ju omožila z bogatima plemičema.

In tako so odtlej vsi srečno živeli do konca svojih dni.",1750
9,THE WOLF AND THE SEVEN LITTLE KIDS,"There was once upon a time an old goat who had seven little kids, and
loved them with all the love of a mother for her children. One day she
wanted to go into the forest and fetch some food. So she called all
seven to her and said: ‘Dear children, I have to go into the forest,
be on your guard against the wolf; if he comes in, he will devour you
all--skin, hair, and everything. The wretch often disguises himself, but
you will know him at once by his rough voice and his black feet.’ The
kids said: ‘Dear mother, we will take good care of ourselves; you may go
away without any anxiety.’ Then the old one bleated, and went on her way
with an easy mind.

It was not long before someone knocked at the house-door and called:
‘Open the door, dear children; your mother is here, and has brought
something back with her for each of you.’ But the little kids knew that
it was the wolf, by the rough voice. ‘We will not open the door,’ cried
they, ‘you are not our mother. She has a soft, pleasant voice, but
your voice is rough; you are the wolf!’ Then the wolf went away to a
shopkeeper and bought himself a great lump of chalk, ate this and made
his voice soft with it. Then he came back, knocked at the door of the
house, and called: ‘Open the door, dear children, your mother is here
and has brought something back with her for each of you.’ But the wolf
had laid his black paws against the window, and the children saw them
and cried: ‘We will not open the door, our mother has not black feet
like you: you are the wolf!’ Then the wolf ran to a baker and said: ‘I
have hurt my feet, rub some dough over them for me.’ And when the baker
had rubbed his feet over, he ran to the miller and said: ‘Strew some
white meal over my feet for me.’ The miller thought to himself: ‘The
wolf wants to deceive someone,’ and refused; but the wolf said: ‘If you
will not do it, I will devour you.’ Then the miller was afraid, and made
his paws white for him. Truly, this is the way of mankind.

So now the wretch went for the third time to the house-door, knocked at
it and said: ‘Open the door for me, children, your dear little mother
has come home, and has brought every one of you something back from the
forest with her.’ The little kids cried: ‘First show us your paws that
we may know if you are our dear little mother.’ Then he put his paws
in through the window and when the kids saw that they were white, they
believed that all he said was true, and opened the door. But who should
come in but the wolf! They were terrified and wanted to hide themselves.
One sprang under the table, the second into the bed, the third into the
stove, the fourth into the kitchen, the fifth into the cupboard, the
sixth under the washing-bowl, and the seventh into the clock-case. But
the wolf found them all, and used no great ceremony; one after the
other he swallowed them down his throat. The youngest, who was in
the clock-case, was the only one he did not find. When the wolf had
satisfied his appetite he took himself off, laid himself down under a
tree in the green meadow outside, and began to sleep. Soon afterwards
the old goat came home again from the forest. Ah! what a sight she saw
there! The house-door stood wide open. The table, chairs, and benches
were thrown down, the washing-bowl lay broken to pieces, and the quilts
and pillows were pulled off the bed. She sought her children, but they
were nowhere to be found. She called them one after another by name, but
no one answered. At last, when she came to the youngest, a soft voice
cried: ‘Dear mother, I am in the clock-case.’ She took the kid out, and
it told her that the wolf had come and had eaten all the others. Then
you may imagine how she wept over her poor children.

At length in her grief she went out, and the youngest kid ran with her.
When they came to the meadow, there lay the wolf by the tree and snored
so loud that the branches shook. She looked at him on every side and
saw that something was moving and struggling in his gorged belly. ‘Ah,
heavens,’ she said, ‘is it possible that my poor children whom he has
swallowed down for his supper, can be still alive?’ Then the kid had to
run home and fetch scissors, and a needle and thread, and the goat cut
open the monster’s stomach, and hardly had she made one cut, than one
little kid thrust its head out, and when she had cut farther, all six
sprang out one after another, and were all still alive, and had suffered
no injury whatever, for in his greediness the monster had swallowed them
down whole. What rejoicing there was! They embraced their dear mother,
and jumped like a tailor at his wedding. The mother, however, said: ‘Now
go and look for some big stones, and we will fill the wicked beast’s
stomach with them while he is still asleep.’ Then the seven kids dragged
the stones thither with all speed, and put as many of them into this
stomach as they could get in; and the mother sewed him up again in the
greatest haste, so that he was not aware of anything and never once
stirred.

When the wolf at length had had his fill of sleep, he got on his legs,
and as the stones in his stomach made him very thirsty, he wanted to
go to a well to drink. But when he began to walk and to move about, the
stones in his stomach knocked against each other and rattled. Then cried
he:

 ‘What rumbles and tumbles
  Against my poor bones?
  I thought ‘twas six kids,
  But it feels like big stones.’

And when he got to the well and stooped over the water to drink, the
heavy stones made him fall in, and he drowned miserably. When the seven
kids saw that, they came running to the spot and cried aloud: ‘The wolf
is dead! The wolf is dead!’ and danced for joy round about the well with
their mother.",1110,volk in sedem kozlickov,"Nekoč je živela koza, ki je imela sedem živahnih kozličkov. Imela jih je rada, kot imajo mame rade svoje otroke.

Nekega dne se je odpravljala v gozd po krmo, zato je sklicala vseh sedem in rekla:

""Dragi otročički, pozorno me poslušajte! Šla bom v gozd, zato boste nekaj časa sami doma. Pazite se volka! Če mu uspe priti v hišo, vas bo pojedel s kostmi in kožo vred. Nepridiprav se pogosto zamaskira, zato morate biti še posebej previdni. Če drugega ne, ga bo izdal raskav glas in črne šape.""

""Previdni bomo, mami,"" so rekli kozlički. ""Lahko si brez skrbi.""

Mama koza je v slovo nežno zameketala in se pomirjena odpravila v gozd.

Nedolgo zatem je potrkalo na vratih. Hripav glas je rekel: ""Odprite vrata, dragi otročički! Vaša mamica se je vrnila in za vsakega ima nekaj lepega.""

Toda kozlički so takoj vedeli, da hripav glas ni od njihove mame. Bil je volk.

""Ne bomo odprli,"" so zaklicali. ""Ti že nisi naša mamica. Ona ima nežen in mehak glas, tvoj pa je globok in hripav. Vemo da si ti, volk!""

Volk je odšel in začel tuhtati, kako bi si zmehčal glas. Potem se mu je posvetilo – kreda! Takoj jo je mahnil k trgovcu, kupil kos krede in jo pojedel. Še sam ni mogel verjeti, kako nežen in mehak je postal njegov glas.

Potem se je vrnil in potrkal: ""Odprite vrata, dragi otročički! Vaša mamica se je vrnila in za vsakega ima nekaj lepega.""

Toda kozlički so videli njegovo črno šapo, ki jo je položil na okensko polico, zato so zaklicali:""Ne bomo odprli! Naša mamica že nima črne šape. Vemo da si ti, volk!""

Spet mu ni uspelo, toda ni se predal. Skočil je do peka in rekel:""Dobri pek, poškodoval sem si taco. Ker testo blaži bolečine, te prosim, da mi z njim obložiš šapo.

Ko mu je pek s testom obložil taco, se je odpravil do mlinarja: ""Mlinar, posuj mi šapo z malo moke!""

Mlinar si je mislil, da premeteni volk gotovo hoče koga ukaniti, zato je odklonil.

Toda volk je zagrozil:""Če tega ne storiš, te bom požrl!""

Mlinar se ga je zelo prestrašil, zato mu je pomokal šapo. Kaj hočemo, ljudje so pač takšni.

Kmalu potem se je malopridnež že tretjič prikazal pred vrati in potrkal: ""Odprite vrata, dragi otročički! Vaša mamica se je vrnila iz gozda in za vsakega ima nekaj lepega.""

Kozlički so zaklicali: ""Najprej nam pokaži svojo nogo, da se prepričamo, ali si res naša mamica.""

Volk je položil šapo na okensko polico in ko so kozlički videli, da je bela, so odprli vrata, misleč, da je njihova mama. A ni bila njihova mama – bil je volk!

Na smrt so se prestrašili in se razbežali na vse konce, da bi se poskrili. Prvi je zlezel pod mizo, drugi pod posteljo, tretji je stekel v kuhinjo, četrti se je skril v pečico, peti v omaro, šesti v korito, sedmi, najmlajši, pa si je našel skrivališče v stenski uri.

Toda volk jih je našel in brez obotavljanja požrl. Enega za drugim je stlačil po žrelu, le najmlajšega, ki se je skril v stensko uro, ni našel. Dodobra sit je potem odšel, se ulegel na travniku pod drevo in zadrnjohal.

Nedolgo zatem se je iz gozda vrnila mama koza. Lahko si predstavljate kakšen grozen prizor jo je dočakal. Vrata so bila na stežaj odprta, hiša razdejana, miza, stoli, klopce – vse prevrnjeno in polomljeno. Kuhinja razbita, spalnica razmetana, njenih ljubih kozličkov pa nikjer.

Preiskala je vso hišo, vendar nikogar ni našla. Enega za drugim je začela klicati po imenu, a nihče se ni oglasil. Naposled pa je poklicala za najmlajšim in oglasil se je drobcen glasek: ""Tukaj sem, mamica, v stenski uri.""

Vzela ga je iz ure in povedal ji je, kako jih je volk ukanil ter požrl vse razen njega. Lahko si predstavljate njeno žalost.

Potrta je stopila na svež zrak, najmlajši kozliček pa je odskakljal za njo. Ko sta prišla do travnika, sta pod drevesom opazila spečega volka. Ta je smrčal tako glasno, da so tresle veje.

Mama koza si je volka previdno ogledovala, ko je opazila, da se v njegovem nabreklem trebuhu nekaj premika. ""O, marička,"" je vzdrhtela. ""Ali je mogoče, da so moji otročički še zmeraj živi?""

Kozlička je takoj poslala po škarje, šivanko in sukanec. Potem je volku prerezala trebuh in glej – že pri prvem rezu je ven pokukala glavica kozlička. Ko je postala luknja dovolj velika, je vseh šest kozličkov drug za drugim skočilo iz trebuha. Vsi so bili živi in zdravi, saj jih je volk v svoji požrešnosti kar cele pogoltnil.

Joj, kako je bila mamica vesela. Svoje ljube otročičke je tesno objela, potem pa jim naročila: ""Ljubi otroci, vsak naj gre in poišče en velik kamen, da bomo z njimi napolnili okrutnežu trebuh, dokler še spi.""

Otroci so kmalu prinesli sedem debelih kamnov in z njimi napolnili volkov trebuh. Mama koza ga je hitro zašila, medtem ko je volk trdno spal. Še ganil se ni.

Ko pa se je naposled prebudil, se je počutil nekam čudno. Močno ga je zažejalo, zato se je namenil stopiti do studenca. Toda takoj, ko je vstal, se je kamenje v njegovem trebuhu premaknilo in zarožljalo. Tedaj je rekel:

""Le kaj v trebuhu se obrača,
tako rožlja in se prevrača?
Šest kozličkov sem pojedel,
pa se zdi, kot da bi kamne snedel.""

Ko je prišel do studenca in se nagnil k vodi, se je sedem kamnov v njegovem trebuhu premaknilo in ga potegnilo v globino. Bil je pretežak, da bi lahko splaval na površje, zato je utonil.

Ko so kozlički videli, kaj se je zgodilo, so začeli kričali: ""Volk je mrtev! Volk je mrtev!"" Skupaj z mamico so nato veselo skakljali in poplesavali okrog studenca. ",950
10,THE FOX AND THE CAT,"It happened that the cat met the fox in a forest, and as she thought to
herself: ‘He is clever and full of experience, and much esteemed in the
world,’ she spoke to him in a friendly way. ‘Good day, dear Mr Fox,
how are you? How is all with you? How are you getting on in these hard
times?’ The fox, full of all kinds of arrogance, looked at the cat from
head to foot, and for a long time did not know whether he would give
any answer or not. At last he said: ‘Oh, you wretched beard-cleaner, you
piebald fool, you hungry mouse-hunter, what can you be thinking of? Have
you the cheek to ask how I am getting on? What have you learnt? How
many arts do you understand?’ ‘I understand but one,’ replied the
cat, modestly. ‘What art is that?’ asked the fox. ‘When the hounds are
following me, I can spring into a tree and save myself.’ ‘Is that all?’
said the fox. ‘I am master of a hundred arts, and have into the bargain
a sackful of cunning. You make me sorry for you; come with me, I will
teach you how people get away from the hounds.’ Just then came a hunter
with four dogs. The cat sprang nimbly up a tree, and sat down at the top
of it, where the branches and foliage quite concealed her. ‘Open your
sack, Mr Fox, open your sack,’ cried the cat to him, but the dogs had
already seized him, and were holding him fast. ‘Ah, Mr Fox,’ cried the
cat. ‘You with your hundred arts are left in the lurch! Had you been
able to climb like me, you would not have lost your life.’",294,lisica in macka,"Po lozi sta hodili lisica in mačka in se prepirali, katera ima več pameti v glavi.

Pravi lisica: »Oj mačka, zbiraj pamet!«

Vpraša mačka: »Hej, lisica, koliko pameti imaš ti?« Se pobaha, lisica: »0j, jaz je imam devet vrst!« Mačka pa reče: »Jaz pa samo dve: gor in dol.«

Prideta v globoko drago. Na dnu te drage je rastla visoka jelka. Zalajali so lovski psi in obkolili kotanjo. Mačka — smuk na jelko. Tam je veselo predla in se smejala lisici, ki so jo gonili lovski psi:

»Hej, lisica, pomagaj si s svojimi deveterimi pametmi! Bolje ti morajo služiti, kakor meni — dve!« ",101
11,THE GOLDEN GOOSE,"There was a man who had three sons, the youngest of whom was called
Dummling,[*] and was despised, mocked, and sneered at on every occasion.

It happened that the eldest wanted to go into the forest to hew wood,
and before he went his mother gave him a beautiful sweet cake and a
bottle of wine in order that he might not suffer from hunger or thirst.

When he entered the forest he met a little grey-haired old man who bade
him good day, and said: ‘Do give me a piece of cake out of your pocket,
and let me have a draught of your wine; I am so hungry and thirsty.’ But
the clever son answered: ‘If I give you my cake and wine, I shall have
none for myself; be off with you,’ and he left the little man standing
and went on.

But when he began to hew down a tree, it was not long before he made a
false stroke, and the axe cut him in the arm, so that he had to go home
and have it bound up. And this was the little grey man’s doing.

After this the second son went into the forest, and his mother gave him,
like the eldest, a cake and a bottle of wine. The little old grey man
met him likewise, and asked him for a piece of cake and a drink of wine.
But the second son, too, said sensibly enough: ‘What I give you will be
taken away from myself; be off!’ and he left the little man standing and
went on. His punishment, however, was not delayed; when he had made a
few blows at the tree he struck himself in the leg, so that he had to be
carried home.

Then Dummling said: ‘Father, do let me go and cut wood.’ The father
answered: ‘Your brothers have hurt themselves with it, leave it alone,
you do not understand anything about it.’ But Dummling begged so long
that at last he said: ‘Just go then, you will get wiser by hurting
yourself.’ His mother gave him a cake made with water and baked in the
cinders, and with it a bottle of sour beer.

When he came to the forest the little old grey man met him likewise,
and greeting him, said: ‘Give me a piece of your cake and a drink out
of your bottle; I am so hungry and thirsty.’ Dummling answered: ‘I have
only cinder-cake and sour beer; if that pleases you, we will sit
down and eat.’ So they sat down, and when Dummling pulled out his
cinder-cake, it was a fine sweet cake, and the sour beer had become good
wine. So they ate and drank, and after that the little man said: ‘Since
you have a good heart, and are willing to divide what you have, I will
give you good luck. There stands an old tree, cut it down, and you will
find something at the roots.’ Then the little man took leave of him.

Dummling went and cut down the tree, and when it fell there was a goose
sitting in the roots with feathers of pure gold. He lifted her up, and
taking her with him, went to an inn where he thought he would stay the
night. Now the host had three daughters, who saw the goose and were
curious to know what such a wonderful bird might be, and would have
liked to have one of its golden feathers.

The eldest thought: ‘I shall soon find an opportunity of pulling out a
feather,’ and as soon as Dummling had gone out she seized the goose by
the wing, but her finger and hand remained sticking fast to it.

The second came soon afterwards, thinking only of how she might get a
feather for herself, but she had scarcely touched her sister than she
was held fast.

At last the third also came with the like intent, and the others
screamed out: ‘Keep away; for goodness’ sake keep away!’ But she did
not understand why she was to keep away. ‘The others are there,’ she
thought, ‘I may as well be there too,’ and ran to them; but as soon as
she had touched her sister, she remained sticking fast to her. So they
had to spend the night with the goose.

The next morning Dummling took the goose under his arm and set out,
without troubling himself about the three girls who were hanging on to
it. They were obliged to run after him continually, now left, now right,
wherever his legs took him.

In the middle of the fields the parson met them, and when he saw the
procession he said: ‘For shame, you good-for-nothing girls, why are you
running across the fields after this young man? Is that seemly?’ At the
same time he seized the youngest by the hand in order to pull her away,
but as soon as he touched her he likewise stuck fast, and was himself
obliged to run behind.

Before long the sexton came by and saw his master, the parson, running
behind three girls. He was astonished at this and called out: ‘Hi!
your reverence, whither away so quickly? Do not forget that we have a
christening today!’ and running after him he took him by the sleeve, but
was also held fast to it.

Whilst the five were trotting thus one behind the other, two labourers
came with their hoes from the fields; the parson called out to them
and begged that they would set him and the sexton free. But they had
scarcely touched the sexton when they were held fast, and now there were
seven of them running behind Dummling and the goose.

Soon afterwards he came to a city, where a king ruled who had a daughter
who was so serious that no one could make her laugh. So he had put forth
a decree that whosoever should be able to make her laugh should marry
her. When Dummling heard this, he went with his goose and all her train
before the king’s daughter, and as soon as she saw the seven people
running on and on, one behind the other, she began to laugh quite
loudly, and as if she would never stop. Thereupon Dummling asked to have
her for his wife; but the king did not like the son-in-law, and made all
manner of excuses and said he must first produce a man who could drink
a cellarful of wine. Dummling thought of the little grey man, who could
certainly help him; so he went into the forest, and in the same place
where he had felled the tree, he saw a man sitting, who had a very
sorrowful face. Dummling asked him what he was taking to heart so
sorely, and he answered: ‘I have such a great thirst and cannot quench
it; cold water I cannot stand, a barrel of wine I have just emptied, but
that to me is like a drop on a hot stone!’

‘There, I can help you,’ said Dummling, ‘just come with me and you shall
be satisfied.’

He led him into the king’s cellar, and the man bent over the huge
barrels, and drank and drank till his loins hurt, and before the day was
out he had emptied all the barrels. Then Dummling asked once more
for his bride, but the king was vexed that such an ugly fellow, whom
everyone called Dummling, should take away his daughter, and he made a
new condition; he must first find a man who could eat a whole mountain
of bread. Dummling did not think long, but went straight into the
forest, where in the same place there sat a man who was tying up his
body with a strap, and making an awful face, and saying: ‘I have eaten a
whole ovenful of rolls, but what good is that when one has such a hunger
as I? My stomach remains empty, and I must tie myself up if I am not to
die of hunger.’

At this Dummling was glad, and said: ‘Get up and come with me; you shall
eat yourself full.’ He led him to the king’s palace where all the
flour in the whole Kingdom was collected, and from it he caused a huge
mountain of bread to be baked. The man from the forest stood before it,
began to eat, and by the end of one day the whole mountain had vanished.
Then Dummling for the third time asked for his bride; but the king again
sought a way out, and ordered a ship which could sail on land and on
water. ‘As soon as you come sailing back in it,’ said he, ‘you shall
have my daughter for wife.’

Dummling went straight into the forest, and there sat the little grey
man to whom he had given his cake. When he heard what Dummling wanted,
he said: ‘Since you have given me to eat and to drink, I will give you
the ship; and I do all this because you once were kind to me.’ Then he
gave him the ship which could sail on land and water, and when the king
saw that, he could no longer prevent him from having his daughter. The
wedding was celebrated, and after the king’s death, Dummling inherited
his kingdom and lived for a long time contentedly with his wife.

     [*] Simpleton",1593,zlata gos,"Nekoč je živel mož, ki je imel tri sinove. Najmlajšemu je bilo ime Bučko in celotna družina se je do njega ves čas vedla zelo grdo. Nekega dne se je najstarejši sin odločil, da gre v gozd sekat drevje; mama mu je zato dala okusno mesno pito in steklenico vina za seboj, da bi mu lahko vrnilo potrebno energijo. Ko je bil na poti v gozd, je srečal starčka, ki mu je zaželel dober dan in ga prosil »bi mi lahko odstopil nekaj mesne pite in nekaj malega vina iz tvoje steklenice; zelo sem lačen in žejen«. A premeteni fant je rekel »Da bi ti dal svojo pito in vino! Ne, hvala. Tako zame ne bi ostalo dovolj.« in odpravil se je naprej.

Kmalu se je lotil sekanja prvega drevesa; ampak ni se dolgo trudil preden je zgrešil in se ranil, zato je moral domov, da bi mu rano oskrbeli.

Naslednji je bil za delo na vrsti srednji sin; tudi njemu je mama dala steklenico vina in mesno pito. Tudi njega je srečal mali starček in ga prosil za nekaj hrane in pijače. In tudi on mu je rekel »karkoli ti dam, potem ne bom imel sam, zato se le umakni!« Stari mali mož se je prepričal, da je tudi ta sin dobil svojo nagrado in ob drugem zamahu s sekiro je zadel svojo nogo in tudi on je moral domov.

Nato je Bučko rekel »Oče, tudi sam bi rad poskusil posekati drevo«. A oče mu je odgovoril »tvoja brata sta se oba poškodovala, bolje bo da ostaneš doma, saj ti o delu nimaš pojma.«

Ampak Bučko ni odnehal in končno si je oče le premislil »Pa pojdi, pametnejši boš, ko jih boš skupil zaradi svoje neumnosti.« Mama mu je dala le nekaj suhega kruha in steklenico grenkega piva; ko pa je prišel do gozda, je takoj srečal malega starega moža, ki mu je rekel »Daj mi nekaj hrane in pijače, res sem lačen in žejen.«

Bučko je odvrnil »ničesar drugega nimam kot star posušen kruh in grenko pivo; če ti to zadošča, se bova usedla in pojedla skupaj«. Tako sta se usedla in ko je mladenič vzel kruh iz svoje torbe se je ta nemudoma spremenil v čudovito mesno pito in njegovo grenko pivo v okusno vino. Veselo sta jedla in pila, ko sta končala je mali mož rekel »ker si dobrega srca in si bil pripravljen z menoj deliti vse, kar si imel, ti bom prinesel dobro. Tamle stoji staro drevo; posekaj ga in v njegovih koreninah te čaka presenečenje« poslovil se je in odšel na pot.

Bučko se je lotil dela in posekal drevo; ko je drevo padlo, je v luknji pod njegovimi koreninami odkril gos, ki je imela zlata peresa. Vzel jih je in se odpravil v gostilno, kjer je nameraval preživeti noč. Gospodar je imel tri hčerke in ko so zagledali njegovo gos, jih je zanimalo kakšna je ta čudovita ptica in se trudili, da bi ji izpulili kakšno pero iz njenega repa. Nazadnje pa je najstarejša rekla »Moram in dobila bom eno pero«. Zato je počakala, da jim je obrnil hrbet in gos prijela za krilo in na njeno presenečenje se je nanjo prilepila, ni mogla odmakniti ne roke, niti enega samega prsta.

Kmalu je prišla druga sestra in prav tako hotela imeti pero, a se je v trenutku, ko se je dotaknila svoje sestre, tudi ona prilepila nanjo. Na koncu pa je prišla še tretja in si želela peresa. Drugi dve sestri sta zaječali »Ne hodi blizu! Lepo te prosiva, pojdi stran!« kakorkoli, ni razumela kaj sta ji hoteli povedati »Če sta že onidve tam« si je mislila »sem lahko tudi jaz« in jima šla naproti. In v trenutku, ko se jih je dotaknila, se je tudi ona zalepila na gosko, tako kot njeni sestri, zato so morale spati poleg nje celo noč.

Naslednje jutro je Bučko odnesel gos v svojih rokah in se ni prav nič menil za tri dekleta, z njimi vred je odšel ven in kamorkoli je šel, so mu morale slediti, če so hotele ali ne so morale teči za njim kolikor hitro so jih nesle noge.

Na sredi njive so srečali župnika in ko je videl to prigodo je rekel »Kaj vas ni sram, ve drzna dekleta, da tako tekate za mladeničem skozi njive? Mar je to primerno obnašanje?«

Prijel se je najmlajše, da bi jo odvlekel stran, a se je v trenutku procesiji pridružil tudi sam.

Takrat je mimo prišel uradnik in ko je videl svojega gospoda, župnika, kako teče za tremi dekleti, je bil močno presenečen in rekel »pozdravljen! Pozdravljen! Vaša častitost! Kam pa greste tako hitro? Danes morate še krstiti.«

Stekel je za njimi in se tudi sam ujel v procesijo.

Ko se jih je tako pet opotekalo eden za drugim, so naleteli na dva delavca s svojim orodjem, ki sta se vračala z dela; župnik jih je poklical, da bi ga rešila. Ampak komaj sta se ga dotaknila, sta se vsem skupaj pridružila še ta dva in tako jih je že sedem teklo za Bučkom in njegovo gosjo.

Končno so prispeli do mesta, v katerem je vladal kralj z edino hčerko. Princesa je bila tako premišljena in resna, da je nikomur ni uspelo spraviti v smeh. Kralj je tako razglasil celemu svetu, da bo njeno roko dal tistemu, ki jo bo uspel nasmejati. Ko je to slišal mladenič, se je odpravil k njej s svojo gosjo in zasledovalci. In ko je zagledala vseh sedem viseti skupaj in teči naokoli, drug drugemu stopati po stopalih si ni mogla pomagati in je bruhnila v smeh.

Tako jo je Bučko dobil za ženo; priredili so poroko in Bučko je postal prestolonaslednik, živel je dolgo in srečno življenje s svojo ženo.",953
12,THE SEVEN RAVENS,"There was once a man who had seven sons, and last of all one daughter.
Although the little girl was very pretty, she was so weak and small that
they thought she could not live; but they said she should at once be
christened.

So the father sent one of his sons in haste to the spring to get some
water, but the other six ran with him. Each wanted to be first at
drawing the water, and so they were in such a hurry that all let their
pitchers fall into the well, and they stood very foolishly looking at
one another, and did not know what to do, for none dared go home. In the
meantime the father was uneasy, and could not tell what made the
young men stay so long. ‘Surely,’ said he, ‘the whole seven must have
forgotten themselves over some game of play’; and when he had waited
still longer and they yet did not come, he flew into a rage and wished
them all turned into ravens. Scarcely had he spoken these words when he
heard a croaking over his head, and looked up and saw seven ravens as
black as coal flying round and round. Sorry as he was to see his wish
so fulfilled, he did not know how what was done could be undone, and
comforted himself as well as he could for the loss of his seven sons
with his dear little daughter, who soon became stronger and every day
more beautiful.

For a long time she did not know that she had ever had any brothers; for
her father and mother took care not to speak of them before her: but one
day by chance she heard the people about her speak of them. ‘Yes,’ said
they, ‘she is beautiful indeed, but still ‘tis a pity that her brothers
should have been lost for her sake.’ Then she was much grieved, and went
to her father and mother, and asked if she had any brothers, and what
had become of them. So they dared no longer hide the truth from her, but
said it was the will of Heaven, and that her birth was only the innocent
cause of it; but the little girl mourned sadly about it every day, and
thought herself bound to do all she could to bring her brothers back;
and she had neither rest nor ease, till at length one day she stole
away, and set out into the wide world to find her brothers, wherever
they might be, and free them, whatever it might cost her.

She took nothing with her but a little ring which her father and mother
had given her, a loaf of bread in case she should be hungry, a little
pitcher of water in case she should be thirsty, and a little stool
to rest upon when she should be weary. Thus she went on and on, and
journeyed till she came to the world’s end; then she came to the sun,
but the sun looked much too hot and fiery; so she ran away quickly to
the moon, but the moon was cold and chilly, and said, ‘I smell flesh
and blood this way!’ so she took herself away in a hurry and came to the
stars, and the stars were friendly and kind to her, and each star sat
upon his own little stool; but the morning star rose up and gave her a
little piece of wood, and said, ‘If you have not this little piece of
wood, you cannot unlock the castle that stands on the glass-mountain,
and there your brothers live.’ The little girl took the piece of wood,
rolled it up in a little cloth, and went on again until she came to the
glass-mountain, and found the door shut. Then she felt for the little
piece of wood; but when she unwrapped the cloth it was not there, and
she saw she had lost the gift of the good stars. What was to be done?
She wanted to save her brothers, and had no key of the castle of the
glass-mountain; so this faithful little sister took a knife out of her
pocket and cut off her little finger, that was just the size of the
piece of wood she had lost, and put it in the door and opened it.

As she went in, a little dwarf came up to her, and said, ‘What are you
seeking for?’ ‘I seek for my brothers, the seven ravens,’ answered she.
Then the dwarf said, ‘My masters are not at home; but if you will wait
till they come, pray step in.’ Now the little dwarf was getting their
dinner ready, and he brought their food upon seven little plates, and
their drink in seven little glasses, and set them upon the table, and
out of each little plate their sister ate a small piece, and out of each
little glass she drank a small drop; but she let the ring that she had
brought with her fall into the last glass.

On a sudden she heard a fluttering and croaking in the air, and the
dwarf said, ‘Here come my masters.’ When they came in, they wanted to
eat and drink, and looked for their little plates and glasses. Then said
one after the other,

‘Who has eaten from my little plate? And who has been drinking out of my
little glass?’

 ‘Caw! Caw! well I ween
  Mortal lips have this way been.’

When the seventh came to the bottom of his glass, and found there the
ring, he looked at it, and knew that it was his father’s and mother’s,
and said, ‘O that our little sister would but come! then we should be
free.’ When the little girl heard this (for she stood behind the door
all the time and listened), she ran forward, and in an instant all
the ravens took their right form again; and all hugged and kissed each
other, and went merrily home.",1014,sedem krokarjev,"Na svetu se dogajajo mnogokrat stvari, katerim se zelo čudimo. Tako se je nekoč pripetilo, da je žena dobila naenkrat sedem dečkov. Vsi so živeli in se razvijali prav krepko. Za nekoliko let pa se ji je rodila še hčerka. Oče teh otročičev je bil jako priden in spreten delavec, zato so mu ljudje radi dajali kaj zaslužiti, ako so rabili ročnega dela. Tako je pošteno preživljal svojo mnogobrojno družinico, pa še toliko pridobival, da je njegova marljiva gospodinja na stran devala kak novčič za silo, ker je natanjčno in vestno uravnavala vse domače potrebe. Toda oče je umrl v najboljših letih in ubogo vdovo je jela stiskati beda, kajti ni si mogla prislužiti toliko. da bi bila redila in oblačila svojih osmero otrok. Dečki so rastli kakor gobe po dežju in so potrebovali vedno več. Na veliko žalost svoje matere so postali vedno razuzdanejši, divji in hudobni. Uboga ženica je komaj prenašala, kar jo je skrbelo in težilo.

Rada bi bila vzgojila svoje otročiče, da bi bili dobri in pobožni, a pomagala ni ne strogost, ne dobrota, dečkom je srce bilo in ostalo otrpnjeno. Zato je rekla nekoč, ko jo je minula vsa potrpežljivost: ,,0, hudobni vi dečki, naj ljubše bi mi bilo, da ste črni krokarji in da odleti te proč od tukaj in da bi vas ne videla nikdar več."" Komaj mati to izusti, izpremeni se vseh sedem dečkov v krokarje, ki zlete skozi okno in izginejo.

Zdaj je mati s svojo jedino hčerko živela mirno in zadovoljno in zaslužili ste si več, nego ste potrebovali. In hčerka je postala zala, dobra in vljudna deklica. Za nekoliko let pa ste obe, mati in hčerka, srčno hrepeneli po sedmerih bratih in sta se pogovarajali o njih ter jih objokovale, rekoč, da bi se bratje vender zopet vrnili in bili dobri mladeniči; kako bi si potem opomogli s svojim delom in kako veselo bi živeli med seboj! In ker je deklica čim dalje srčnejše hrepenela po svojih bratih, reče nekoč materi: ""Draga mati, dovoli mi, da odpotujem in poiščem brate; hočem jih pripraviti na pot poštenja in odvaditi zlobnosti. Na starost naj ti bodo v čast in veselje!"" Mati ji nato reče:

""Blaga hčerka, ne smem in nočem ti braniti tega dela; tvoja želja je tudi moja želja, pojdi po svetu in Bog' bodi s teboj!"" Nato ji je dala majhen zlat prstan, ki ga je že kot otrok nosila na prstu, ko so se bratje prelevili v krokarje.

Dekle se takoj odpravi in gre dalječ dalječ proč, a dolgo ne more zaslediti bratov . Nekoč pride do jako visoke gore, na vrhu je stala mala hišica. Da bi se nekoliko počila, sede ob vznožju v travo in zre premišljevaje vedno gori na hišico. Zdela se ji je zdaj kakor tičje gnezdo, kajti bila je siva, kakor da bi bila zložena iz kamenčkov in ila, zdaj se ji je zopet videla kakor človeško bivališče. Mislila je: Kaj, ko bi tu gori stanovali moji bratje? In motila se ni. Kmalu izleti sedem krokarjev iz hišice, in to je še bolj potrdilo njeno domnevanje. Vesela se dvigne in poda v breg. Pot pa, ki je vodila do vrha, je bila potlakana s čudnimi, steklenogladkimi kameni, da je vsakokrat, ko je z velikim trudom prišla nekoliko navzgor, podrsnila in padla nazaj. Vsa potrta ni vedela, kaj bi storila, da bi prišla do vrha.

V tem zazre lepo belo gos ter si misli, ko bi le imela njene peruti, potem bi bila kmalu gori. Zdaj zopet ugiba, da li bi jej ne mogla odrezati peruti? Potem bi ji bilo pomagano. Vjame torej lepo gos, odreže ji peruti in nogi in si oboje prišije na život. In glej, ko poskuša leteti, šlo je jako ročno, lahko in dobro, in če se je utrudila pri letanju, tekala je nekaj časa z gosjima nogama, ne da bi se ji kdaj zdrsnilo. Tako je prišla naglo in srečno do cilja toliko zaželjenega.

Na vrh dospevši, stopi takoj v hišico, pa hišica je neznano majhna. Notri je stalo sedem jako majhnih mizic, sedem stolcev, sedem posteljic, in sedem oknic je razsvitljevalo sobico. V peči je stalo sedem skledic, v njih so bile pečene ptičice in ocvrta jajčka. Dobra sestrica je bila zelo utrujena vsled dolgega potovanja, ter se je veselila, da je mogla malo počivati, tudi je bila že lačna. Vzame torej sedem skledic iz peči in zavžije iz vsake nekoliko hrane, vsede se na vsak stolček, po leži malo v vsaki posteljici, in na zadnji posteljici pa zaspi in leži tako dolgo, da je vseh sedem bratov prišlo domov. Vsak je priletel skozi svoje oknice v hišico, vzel svojo skledico iz peči, da bi bil jedel; a takoj so zapazili, da si je kdo že postregel. Zdaj so hoteli spat iti, a našli so svoja ležišča premaknjena, in eden bratov glasno zakriči rekoč : ""Joj, kakšna deklica leži v moji posteljici !"" Drugi bratje naglo priskočijo in gledajo začudeni spečo deklico. Na to pravijo drug za drugim: ,,0, da bi ta vender bila naša sestrica!"" In zopet se oglasi drug za drugim poln radosti: ""Da, ta je naša sestrica, da, ta je! Take laske je imela in taka ustica, in prav tak prstanček je nosila na kazalcu, ka¬koršnega ima zdaj na mezincu!"" In vsi so vri¬skali ter poljubovali sestrico; ona pa je spala tako trdno, da se dolgo ni zbudila.

Končno pa deklica odpre oči in vidi, da sedmero bratov sedi krog njene postelje. Zdaj reče: ,,0, bodite srčno pozdravljeni, ljubi moji bratje, hvala Bogu, da sem vas vender našla; zaradi vas storila sem dolgo dolgo pot, da vas rešim iz prognanstva, ako se je vaše srce kaj ublažilo, da ne bodete več žalili svoje matere, da bodete z nama delali marljivo na čast in veselje svoje priletne matere."" Med tem govorom so bratje bridko jokali ter obljubili:

""Predraga sestra! da, dobri hočemo biti in nikdar več ne žaliti matere; oh, prestali smo kot krokarji mnogo gorja, in predno smo si zgradili to hišico, umirali smo od gladu in bede. Pridružilo se je še kesanje, ki nas je mučilo noč in dan, kajti žreti smo morali mrtvaška trupla ubogih obsojencev in to nas je vedno spominjalo na grozoviti konec grešnika. ""

Sestra je plakala od radosti, da so se bratje spokorili ter govorili tako ginljivo in pobožno. ""O!"" je vzkliknila, ""zdaj je vse poravnano; ko pridete domov, in bode mati čula, da ste se poboljšali, odpustila vam bode iz vsega srca in vas prerodila zopet v ljudi.""

Ko so se bratje s sestrico odpravljali, da bi se vrnili na svoj dom, odprli so leseno omarico ter rekli: ""Mila sestra, na! vzemi te krasne zlate prstane z leskečimi kamenci, ki smo jih našli tu in tam na svojih izletih; stre si jih v svoj predpasnik in odnesi na dom; žnjimi bomo kot ljudje obogateli. Kot krokarji smo jih nabirali zaradi njih blestečega leska. ""

Sestrica stori tako, kakor hočejo bratje, in krasni lišp jo neizrekljivo veseli. Potovaje proti domu poneso krokarski bratje zdaj jeden, zdaj drugi sestrico na svojih perutih, dokler ne pridejo do materinega bivališča. Tu zletijo skozi okno v hišico ter prosijo mater odpuščanja. obljubovaje, da hočejo v bodočnosti biti pridni in dobri otroci. Tudi sestra prosi zanje in mati vsa srečna in vesela prizanese vse svojim sinovom. V tem se izpremene zopet v ljudi, v prav zale, vrle mladeniče ene velikosti in jednake ljubeznivosti. Hvaležno objemajo in poljubujejo dobro mamico in milo sestrico.

Kmalu potem se je vseh sedem bratov oženilo, osnubili so mlada in priljudna dekleta, zgradili si veliko, krasno hišo, kajti za svoje dragocenosti so dobili prav obilo denarja in prva slovesnost v novem poslopju je bila sed¬mera poroka in imenitna svatba.

Potem je tudi sestra vzela vrlega moža, a je morala na prigovaJjanje in prošnjo svojih bratov ostati pri njih pod isto streho.

Tako je učakala dobra mamica premnogo radosti pri svojih otrocih, ki so ji ljubeznivo stregli in jo otroško spoštovali do pozne starosti. ",1321
13,THE STORY OF THE YOUTH WHO WENT FORTH TO LEARN WHAT FEAR WAS,"A certain father had two sons, the elder of who was smart and sensible,
and could do everything, but the younger was stupid and could neither
learn nor understand anything, and when people saw him they said:
‘There’s a fellow who will give his father some trouble!’ When anything
had to be done, it was always the elder who was forced to do it; but
if his father bade him fetch anything when it was late, or in the
night-time, and the way led through the churchyard, or any other dismal
place, he answered: ‘Oh, no father, I’ll not go there, it makes me
shudder!’ for he was afraid. Or when stories were told by the fire at
night which made the flesh creep, the listeners sometimes said: ‘Oh,
it makes us shudder!’ The younger sat in a corner and listened with
the rest of them, and could not imagine what they could mean. ‘They are
always saying: “It makes me shudder, it makes me shudder!” It does not
make me shudder,’ thought he. ‘That, too, must be an art of which I
understand nothing!’

Now it came to pass that his father said to him one day: ‘Hearken to me,
you fellow in the corner there, you are growing tall and strong, and you
too must learn something by which you can earn your bread. Look how your
brother works, but you do not even earn your salt.’ ‘Well, father,’ he
replied, ‘I am quite willing to learn something--indeed, if it could but
be managed, I should like to learn how to shudder. I don’t understand
that at all yet.’ The elder brother smiled when he heard that, and
thought to himself: ‘Goodness, what a blockhead that brother of mine is!
He will never be good for anything as long as he lives! He who wants to
be a sickle must bend himself betimes.’

The father sighed, and answered him: ‘You shall soon learn what it is to
shudder, but you will not earn your bread by that.’

Soon after this the sexton came to the house on a visit, and the father
bewailed his trouble, and told him how his younger son was so backward
in every respect that he knew nothing and learnt nothing. ‘Just think,’
said he, ‘when I asked him how he was going to earn his bread, he
actually wanted to learn to shudder.’ ‘If that be all,’ replied the
sexton, ‘he can learn that with me. Send him to me, and I will soon
polish him.’ The father was glad to do it, for he thought: ‘It will
train the boy a little.’ The sexton therefore took him into his house,
and he had to ring the church bell. After a day or two, the sexton awoke
him at midnight, and bade him arise and go up into the church tower and
ring the bell. ‘You shall soon learn what shuddering is,’ thought he,
and secretly went there before him; and when the boy was at the top of
the tower and turned round, and was just going to take hold of the bell
rope, he saw a white figure standing on the stairs opposite the sounding
hole. ‘Who is there?’ cried he, but the figure made no reply, and did
not move or stir. ‘Give an answer,’ cried the boy, ‘or take yourself
off, you have no business here at night.’

The sexton, however, remained standing motionless that the boy might
think he was a ghost. The boy cried a second time: ‘What do you want
here?--speak if you are an honest fellow, or I will throw you down the
steps!’ The sexton thought: ‘He can’t mean to be as bad as his words,’
uttered no sound and stood as if he were made of stone. Then the boy
called to him for the third time, and as that was also to no purpose,
he ran against him and pushed the ghost down the stairs, so that it fell
down the ten steps and remained lying there in a corner. Thereupon he
rang the bell, went home, and without saying a word went to bed, and
fell asleep. The sexton’s wife waited a long time for her husband, but
he did not come back. At length she became uneasy, and wakened the boy,
and asked: ‘Do you know where my husband is? He climbed up the tower
before you did.’ ‘No, I don’t know,’ replied the boy, ‘but someone was
standing by the sounding hole on the other side of the steps, and as he
would neither give an answer nor go away, I took him for a scoundrel,
and threw him downstairs. Just go there and you will see if it was he.
I should be sorry if it were.’ The woman ran away and found her husband,
who was lying moaning in the corner, and had broken his leg.

She carried him down, and then with loud screams she hastened to the
boy’s father, ‘Your boy,’ cried she, ‘has been the cause of a great
misfortune! He has thrown my husband down the steps so that he broke his
leg. Take the good-for-nothing fellow out of our house.’ The father was
terrified, and ran thither and scolded the boy. ‘What wicked tricks
are these?’ said he. ‘The devil must have put them into your head.’
‘Father,’ he replied, ‘do listen to me. I am quite innocent. He was
standing there by night like one intent on doing evil. I did not know
who it was, and I entreated him three times either to speak or to go
away.’ ‘Ah,’ said the father, ‘I have nothing but unhappiness with you.
Go out of my sight. I will see you no more.’

‘Yes, father, right willingly, wait only until it is day. Then will I
go forth and learn how to shudder, and then I shall, at any rate,
understand one art which will support me.’ ‘Learn what you will,’ spoke
the father, ‘it is all the same to me. Here are fifty talers for you.
Take these and go into the wide world, and tell no one from whence you
come, and who is your father, for I have reason to be ashamed of you.’
‘Yes, father, it shall be as you will. If you desire nothing more than
that, I can easily keep it in mind.’

When the day dawned, therefore, the boy put his fifty talers into his
pocket, and went forth on the great highway, and continually said to
himself: ‘If I could but shudder! If I could but shudder!’ Then a man
approached who heard this conversation which the youth was holding with
himself, and when they had walked a little farther to where they could
see the gallows, the man said to him: ‘Look, there is the tree where
seven men have married the ropemaker’s daughter, and are now learning
how to fly. Sit down beneath it, and wait till night comes, and you will
soon learn how to shudder.’ ‘If that is all that is wanted,’ answered
the youth, ‘it is easily done; but if I learn how to shudder as fast as
that, you shall have my fifty talers. Just come back to me early in the
morning.’ Then the youth went to the gallows, sat down beneath it, and
waited till evening came. And as he was cold, he lighted himself a fire,
but at midnight the wind blew so sharply that in spite of his fire, he
could not get warm. And as the wind knocked the hanged men against each
other, and they moved backwards and forwards, he thought to himself:
‘If you shiver below by the fire, how those up above must freeze and
suffer!’ And as he felt pity for them, he raised the ladder, and climbed
up, unbound one of them after the other, and brought down all seven.
Then he stoked the fire, blew it, and set them all round it to warm
themselves. But they sat there and did not stir, and the fire caught
their clothes. So he said: ‘Take care, or I will hang you up again.’ The
dead men, however, did not hear, but were quite silent, and let their
rags go on burning. At this he grew angry, and said: ‘If you will not
take care, I cannot help you, I will not be burnt with you,’ and he hung
them up again each in his turn. Then he sat down by his fire and fell
asleep, and the next morning the man came to him and wanted to have
the fifty talers, and said: ‘Well do you know how to shudder?’ ‘No,’
answered he, ‘how should I know? Those fellows up there did not open
their mouths, and were so stupid that they let the few old rags which
they had on their bodies get burnt.’ Then the man saw that he would not
get the fifty talers that day, and went away saying: ‘Such a youth has
never come my way before.’

The youth likewise went his way, and once more began to mutter to
himself: ‘Ah, if I could but shudder! Ah, if I could but shudder!’ A
waggoner who was striding behind him heard this and asked: ‘Who are
you?’ ‘I don’t know,’ answered the youth. Then the waggoner asked: ‘From
whence do you come?’ ‘I know not.’ ‘Who is your father?’ ‘That I may
not tell you.’ ‘What is it that you are always muttering between your
teeth?’ ‘Ah,’ replied the youth, ‘I do so wish I could shudder, but
no one can teach me how.’ ‘Enough of your foolish chatter,’ said the
waggoner. ‘Come, go with me, I will see about a place for you.’ The
youth went with the waggoner, and in the evening they arrived at an inn
where they wished to pass the night. Then at the entrance of the parlour
the youth again said quite loudly: ‘If I could but shudder! If I could
but shudder!’ The host who heard this, laughed and said: ‘If that is
your desire, there ought to be a good opportunity for you here.’ ‘Ah,
be silent,’ said the hostess, ‘so many prying persons have already lost
their lives, it would be a pity and a shame if such beautiful eyes as
these should never see the daylight again.’

But the youth said: ‘However difficult it may be, I will learn it. For
this purpose indeed have I journeyed forth.’ He let the host have
no rest, until the latter told him, that not far from thence stood a
haunted castle where anyone could very easily learn what shuddering was,
if he would but watch in it for three nights. The king had promised that
he who would venture should have his daughter to wife, and she was the
most beautiful maiden the sun shone on. Likewise in the castle lay great
treasures, which were guarded by evil spirits, and these treasures would
then be freed, and would make a poor man rich enough. Already many men
had gone into the castle, but as yet none had come out again. Then the
youth went next morning to the king, and said: ‘If it be allowed, I will
willingly watch three nights in the haunted castle.’

The king looked at him, and as the youth pleased him, he said: ‘You may
ask for three things to take into the castle with you, but they must
be things without life.’ Then he answered: ‘Then I ask for a fire, a
turning lathe, and a cutting-board with the knife.’

The king had these things carried into the castle for him during the
day. When night was drawing near, the youth went up and made himself
a bright fire in one of the rooms, placed the cutting-board and knife
beside it, and seated himself by the turning-lathe. ‘Ah, if I could
but shudder!’ said he, ‘but I shall not learn it here either.’ Towards
midnight he was about to poke his fire, and as he was blowing it,
something cried suddenly from one corner: ‘Au, miau! how cold we are!’
‘You fools!’ cried he, ‘what are you crying about? If you are cold, come
and take a seat by the fire and warm yourselves.’ And when he had said
that, two great black cats came with one tremendous leap and sat down
on each side of him, and looked savagely at him with their fiery
eyes. After a short time, when they had warmed themselves, they said:
‘Comrade, shall we have a game of cards?’ ‘Why not?’ he replied, ‘but
just show me your paws.’ Then they stretched out their claws. ‘Oh,’ said
he, ‘what long nails you have! Wait, I must first cut them for you.’
Thereupon he seized them by the throats, put them on the cutting-board
and screwed their feet fast. ‘I have looked at your fingers,’ said he,
‘and my fancy for card-playing has gone,’ and he struck them dead and
threw them out into the water. But when he had made away with these two,
and was about to sit down again by his fire, out from every hole and
corner came black cats and black dogs with red-hot chains, and more
and more of them came until he could no longer move, and they yelled
horribly, and got on his fire, pulled it to pieces, and tried to put
it out. He watched them for a while quietly, but at last when they were
going too far, he seized his cutting-knife, and cried: ‘Away with you,
vermin,’ and began to cut them down. Some of them ran away, the others
he killed, and threw out into the fish-pond. When he came back he fanned
the embers of his fire again and warmed himself. And as he thus sat, his
eyes would keep open no longer, and he felt a desire to sleep. Then he
looked round and saw a great bed in the corner. ‘That is the very thing
for me,’ said he, and got into it. When he was just going to shut his
eyes, however, the bed began to move of its own accord, and went over
the whole of the castle. ‘That’s right,’ said he, ‘but go faster.’ Then
the bed rolled on as if six horses were harnessed to it, up and down,
over thresholds and stairs, but suddenly hop, hop, it turned over upside
down, and lay on him like a mountain. But he threw quilts and pillows up
in the air, got out and said: ‘Now anyone who likes, may drive,’ and
lay down by his fire, and slept till it was day. In the morning the king
came, and when he saw him lying there on the ground, he thought the evil
spirits had killed him and he was dead. Then said he: ‘After all it is a
pity,--for so handsome a man.’ The youth heard it, got up, and said: ‘It
has not come to that yet.’ Then the king was astonished, but very glad,
and asked how he had fared. ‘Very well indeed,’ answered he; ‘one
night is past, the two others will pass likewise.’ Then he went to the
innkeeper, who opened his eyes very wide, and said: ‘I never expected to
see you alive again! Have you learnt how to shudder yet?’ ‘No,’ said he,
‘it is all in vain. If someone would but tell me!’

The second night he again went up into the old castle, sat down by the
fire, and once more began his old song: ‘If I could but shudder!’ When
midnight came, an uproar and noise of tumbling about was heard; at
first it was low, but it grew louder and louder. Then it was quiet for
a while, and at length with a loud scream, half a man came down the
chimney and fell before him. ‘Hullo!’ cried he, ‘another half belongs
to this. This is not enough!’ Then the uproar began again, there was a
roaring and howling, and the other half fell down likewise. ‘Wait,’ said
he, ‘I will just stoke up the fire a little for you.’ When he had done
that and looked round again, the two pieces were joined together, and a
hideous man was sitting in his place. ‘That is no part of our bargain,’
said the youth, ‘the bench is mine.’ The man wanted to push him away;
the youth, however, would not allow that, but thrust him off with all
his strength, and seated himself again in his own place. Then still more
men fell down, one after the other; they brought nine dead men’s legs
and two skulls, and set them up and played at nine-pins with them. The
youth also wanted to play and said: ‘Listen you, can I join you?’ ‘Yes,
if you have any money.’ ‘Money enough,’ replied he, ‘but your balls are
not quite round.’ Then he took the skulls and put them in the lathe and
turned them till they were round. ‘There, now they will roll better!’
said he. ‘Hurrah! now we’ll have fun!’ He played with them and lost some
of his money, but when it struck twelve, everything vanished from his
sight. He lay down and quietly fell asleep. Next morning the king came
to inquire after him. ‘How has it fared with you this time?’ asked he.
‘I have been playing at nine-pins,’ he answered, ‘and have lost a couple
of farthings.’ ‘Have you not shuddered then?’ ‘What?’ said he, ‘I have
had a wonderful time! If I did but know what it was to shudder!’

The third night he sat down again on his bench and said quite sadly:
‘If I could but shudder.’ When it grew late, six tall men came in and
brought a coffin. Then he said: ‘Ha, ha, that is certainly my little
cousin, who died only a few days ago,’ and he beckoned with his finger,
and cried: ‘Come, little cousin, come.’ They placed the coffin on the
ground, but he went to it and took the lid off, and a dead man lay
therein. He felt his face, but it was cold as ice. ‘Wait,’ said he, ‘I
will warm you a little,’ and went to the fire and warmed his hand and
laid it on the dead man’s face, but he remained cold. Then he took him
out, and sat down by the fire and laid him on his breast and rubbed his
arms that the blood might circulate again. As this also did no good, he
thought to himself: ‘When two people lie in bed together, they warm each
other,’ and carried him to the bed, covered him over and lay down by
him. After a short time the dead man became warm too, and began to move.
Then said the youth, ‘See, little cousin, have I not warmed you?’ The
dead man, however, got up and cried: ‘Now will I strangle you.’

‘What!’ said he, ‘is that the way you thank me? You shall at once go
into your coffin again,’ and he took him up, threw him into it, and shut
the lid. Then came the six men and carried him away again. ‘I cannot
manage to shudder,’ said he. ‘I shall never learn it here as long as I
live.’

Then a man entered who was taller than all others, and looked terrible.
He was old, however, and had a long white beard. ‘You wretch,’ cried he,
‘you shall soon learn what it is to shudder, for you shall die.’ ‘Not so
fast,’ replied the youth. ‘If I am to die, I shall have to have a say
in it.’ ‘I will soon seize you,’ said the fiend. ‘Softly, softly, do not
talk so big. I am as strong as you are, and perhaps even stronger.’
‘We shall see,’ said the old man. ‘If you are stronger, I will let you
go--come, we will try.’ Then he led him by dark passages to a smith’s
forge, took an axe, and with one blow struck an anvil into the ground.
‘I can do better than that,’ said the youth, and went to the other
anvil. The old man placed himself near and wanted to look on, and his
white beard hung down. Then the youth seized the axe, split the anvil
with one blow, and in it caught the old man’s beard. ‘Now I have you,’
said the youth. ‘Now it is your turn to die.’ Then he seized an iron bar
and beat the old man till he moaned and entreated him to stop, when he
would give him great riches. The youth drew out the axe and let him go.
The old man led him back into the castle, and in a cellar showed him
three chests full of gold. ‘Of these,’ said he, ‘one part is for the
poor, the other for the king, the third yours.’ In the meantime it
struck twelve, and the spirit disappeared, so that the youth stood in
darkness. ‘I shall still be able to find my way out,’ said he, and felt
about, found the way into the room, and slept there by his fire.
Next morning the king came and said: ‘Now you must have learnt what
shuddering is?’ ‘No,’ he answered; ‘what can it be? My dead cousin was
here, and a bearded man came and showed me a great deal of money down
below, but no one told me what it was to shudder.’ ‘Then,’ said the
king, ‘you have saved the castle, and shall marry my daughter.’ ‘That
is all very well,’ said he, ‘but still I do not know what it is to
shudder!’

Then the gold was brought up and the wedding celebrated; but howsoever
much the young king loved his wife, and however happy he was, he still
said always: ‘If I could but shudder--if I could but shudder.’ And this
at last angered her. Her waiting-maid said: ‘I will find a cure for him;
he shall soon learn what it is to shudder.’ She went out to the stream
which flowed through the garden, and had a whole bucketful of gudgeons
brought to her. At night when the young king was sleeping, his wife was
to draw the clothes off him and empty the bucket full of cold water
with the gudgeons in it over him, so that the little fishes would
sprawl about him. Then he woke up and cried: ‘Oh, what makes me shudder
so?--what makes me shudder so, dear wife? Ah! now I know what it is to
shudder!’",3815,o mladenicu ki bi rad strah poznal,"O mladeniču, ki bi rad strah poznal

Mati je imela sina, ki ni poznal strahu. Ker je tolikokrat slišal o njem, vpraša nekega dne mater: »Mati, povejte mi vendar, kaj je to — strah?«

H Mati mu pravi: »Veš, ljubi sinko, strah je taka stvar, ki je na sredi votla, okoli kraja je pa nič ni.«

»Ej, mati,« odgovori sin, »nekaj pa mora vendarle biti strah, ko toliko govore o njem; spoznati ga moram, čeprav grem do konca sveta!«

In res se nekega dne poslovi od matere in odide po svetu, da bi spoznal strah.

V neki vasi se ponudi za hlapca, rekoč: »Jaz ostanem pri vas za hlapca zastonj, če mi pokažete strah; rad bi ga spoznal, ker mi toliko govore o njem.«

Gospodar ga je pripravljen vzeti v službo, rekoč: »No, pa ostani pri meni; jaz ti že pokažem strah.« Nekaj dni prej so v tisti vasi obesili razbojnika; visel je že dalj časa na vešalih.

Ko se nekega večera vračata gospodar in hlapec iz gozda domov, gresta mimo vešal in gospodar skrivaj spusti sekiro na tla. — Že sta skoraj doma, ko veli gospodar hlapcu: »Na poti sem izgubil sekiro, pojdi ponjo!«

Hlapec gre po isti poti, kjer sta šla, ko pride do vešal, se oglasi obešenec: »Oh, kako sem žejen!«

Hlapec pogleda kvišku in pravi: »Če si žejen, pa pij!« To reče in s klobukom zajame vode v bližnji luži in mu ponudi, rekoč: »Na, pij!«

Ko hlapec odhaja, se spet oglasi obešenec: »Joj, kako sem žejen!«

»I, boš pa spet pil,« reče hlapec in mu ponudi vode. »Zdaj mislim, da si se že napil,« še pravi in hoče dalje, a tretjič se oglasi oni na vešalih: »Joj, kako sem žejen!«

»Če si res tako žejen,« pravi hlapec, spleza na vešala in obešenca odreže. Potem ga nese k luži in mu potisne glavo vanjo, rekoč: »Pa vso posrebaj, če hočeš!« Ko potem najde sekiro, se vrne.

Doma pripoveduje gospodarju, kako je dajal piti obešencu, ki ga je prosil vode. »Mislil je, da ga bom vso noč napajal, no, in veste, kaj sem storil? Odrezal sem ga z vešal in postavil na glavo v lužo. Zdaj mislim, da se že napije, ali ne!«

»Ti si srčen dečko!« pravi gospodar.

»Rekli ste, da mi pokažete strah,« reče hlapec, »kdaj pa bo to, oče?«

»Pri meni ga ne boš videl,« odgovori gospodar, »in mislim, da ga ti sploh ne najdeš nikjer.« Drugega dne že gre mladenič spet iskat strahu po svetu.

Slišal je, da v nekem mlinu straši, da hodi vanj vsako noč devet vragov mlet moko in kvartat. Pri tem mlinu se torej mladenič ponudi za hlapca in mlinar ga sprejme.

Zvečer, ko so šli vsi iz mlina zaradi strahov, se mladenič zapre sam vanj in pričakuje vragov. — Skoraj pridejo drug za drugim v mlin. Nekateri odpro zatvornice in meljejo, drugi sedejo okoli mize in vržejo karte. Mladenič jih gleda od strani in vragi ga ne zapazijo.

Skoraj izteče eden mlinskih kamnov, ker ni več meljiva pod njim, mladenič pa zgrabi bližnjega vraga za vrat in mu potisne glavo pod kamen, da mu jo odmelje.

»Jaz vas že naučim, da boste nekoliko bolj pazili na kamne, da se ne bodo prazni vrteli! In če se mi takoj ne poberete od tu, zmeljem vas vse, kolikor vas je!«

Vragi se ga res zboje in zbeže, mladenič pa leže počivat in srečno prespi vso noč. Toda strahu, kakršnega je hotel poznati, le ni videl. Zato drugo jutro takoj odpove službo in gre dalje po svetu.

Na poti sliši, da v starem gradu straši. V ta grad se torej nameni in se ponudi za hlapca. Ko ga graščak sprejme, mu mladenič pove, da za plačilo ne zahteva drugega, kakor da mu pokažejo strah. — »Ej, pri nas,« pravi graščak, »ga boš še preveč užil, če ostaneš!«

Bil je to star grad, o katerem so vedeli pripovedovati ljudje silno mnogo. Zvečer, ko odidejo vsi iz gradu, ostane mladenič sam v njem, da bi videl strah.

Proti polnoči je lačen, gre v kuhinjo, zakuri in pristavi k ognju lonec kaše. Ko bije ura polnoč, sliši nad sabo glas: »Oj, padel bom!« Mladenič pogleda kvišku, in ko ničesar ne opazi, pravi: »Ej, le padi, samo glej, da ne v moj lonec!« Komaj to izgovori, že pade velika noga na tla. Mladenič se za to mnogo ne meni, temveč kuha dalje svojo kašo. — Spet se začuje glas: »Joj, padel bom!« — »Le padi,« odgovori mladenič, »jaz ti ne branim, samo v mojo kašo ne!« In druga noga pade na tla. Tretjič se zasliši glas: »Joj, padel bom!« — »Le padi, kakor ti drago!« odgovori mladenič, in že leži roka na tleh. — Četrtič se začuje: »Joj, padel bom!« — »Le padi!« reče pogumno mladenič in druga roka s trupom vred pade na tla. Mladenič je kuhano kašo že odstavil od ognja, ko spet zasliši glas: »Joj, padel bom!« — »Ne jezi me! Kar padi!« odgovori nevoljno mladenič, »sicer ti grem

pomagat, da laže padeš!« — Zdaj pade velikanska glava z ropotom na tla. V tem hipu se združijo vsi udje in velikan se postavi predenj na noge.

»Kdo pa si ti?« ga vpraša mladenič. Ko pa ne dobi odgovora, dene svojo kašo lepo v skledo in jo nese v sobo. Velikan stopa za njim.

Mladenič sede za mizo in je. Velikan, ki doslej ni dal glasu od sebe, se zdaj oglasi, rekoč: »Daj mi nekoliko kaše!«

»Tam je kuhinja in lonec, pa si jo skuhaj, kakor sem si jo moral jaz, če hočeš jesti. Sicer se poberi, da me ne ujeziš!«

Toda velikan se ne gane, niti ne zine besedice. Ko mladenič kašo poje in vidi, da velikan še vedno stoji pred njim, ga pogleda srepo in reče: »Zdaj se mi pa le zgubi, da grem spat! Tu mi ne boš razsajal in rogovilil, kajti imeti hočem mir.«

Velikana te besede ujeze, pa stegne roke, da bi prijel mladeniča za vrat; tisti hip prime mladenič prižgano svečo in mu jo vtakne pod nos, da velikan takoj odstopi.

»Velik si in premalo te ni,« pravi mladenič, »toda veruj mi, da se te kaj malo bojim, in če boš dolgo iskal, tudi skoraj katero iztakneš!«

Velikan ne odgovori nič, temveč se stegne na polico nad vrati in vzame ključ z nje. »Pojdi za menoj!« reče mladeniču, in le-ta stopa za njim.

»Odpri vrata!« veli velikan.

»O, le sam jih odpri!« odgovori mladenič. »Ti si jih zadnji zaprl, zato jih tudi prvi odpri!«

Velikan mora zdaj sam prijeti za kljuko in odpreti. Ko prideta do kuhinjskih vrat, spet postoji velikan in veli mladeniču, naj jih odpre.

»Prijatelj, ne jezi me in jih sam odpri!« odgovori mladenič. »Ti si jih zadnji zaprl, ti jih torej tudi odpri!«

Velikan odpre vrata. Stopita v kuhinjo, kjer je prej mladenič kuhal kašo. Iz kuhinje so držale duri v klet, ki so bile pa zaklenjene.

»Sezi na polico!« veli velikan, »in vzemi ključ z nje ter odpri!«

»Jaz že ne!« reče mladenič. »Kdor jih je zaklenil, naj jih tudi odpre!«

Spet mora velikan sam odpreti. Zdaj prideta v prostorno klet, kjer zagleda mladenič tri velike kadi; v prvi so bili cekini, v drugi srebrni denarji, v tretji bakreni novci. Velikan se obrne k mladeniču in mu reče: »Vidiš, ko bi me ti slušal in kje odprl vrata, bi te raztrgal na drobne kosce. Poslušaj in povem ti, kdo sem! Nekdaj sem bil gospodar tega gradu in čeprav sem bil neizmerno bogat, sem kljub temu neusmiljeno tlačil in zatiral svoje podložnike. Toda ne samo, da sem kmete grozovito zatiral, celo varal sem jih. Zato se pokorim malone že sto let. Denar, ki ga vidiš v teh kadeh, sem si pridobil po krivici. — S tem, da me nisi slušal, ko sem ti velel odpreti vrata, si me rešil strašne pokore. Z denarjem stori, kakor ti rečem: Tretjino obdrži sam, tretjino razdeli siromakom, tretjino pa izroči sedanjemu lastniku tega gradu!« Ko to izgovori, velikan izgine.

Vtem se je že zdanilo. Mladenič vzame denar in stori z njim, kakor mu je naročil duh.

Ker le ni videl strahu, kakršnega je hotel poznati, odide iz gradu in se napoti domov. Med potom se užeja, zato gre k studencu pit. Ko pije, skoči žaba v vodo in on se je tako prestraši, da ga kar kurja polt oblije.

»Ej,« pravi sam sebi, »zdaj pa vidim, da res ni strahu, da je na sredi votel, okoli ga pa nič ni.«",1392
