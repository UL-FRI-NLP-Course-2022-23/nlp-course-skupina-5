0,THE TRAVELLING MUSICIANS,"An honest farmer had once an ass that had been a faithful servant to him
a great many years, but was now growing old and every day more and more
unfit for work. His master therefore was tired of keeping him and
began to think of putting an end to him; but the ass, who saw that some
mischief was in the wind, took himself slyly off, and began his journey
towards the great city, ‘For there,’ thought he, ‘I may turn musician.’

After he had travelled a little way, he spied a dog lying by the
roadside and panting as if he were tired. ‘What makes you pant so, my
friend?’ said the ass. ‘Alas!’ said the dog, ‘my master was going to
knock me on the head, because I am old and weak, and can no longer make
myself useful to him in hunting; so I ran away; but what can I do to
earn my livelihood?’ ‘Hark ye!’ said the ass, ‘I am going to the great
city to turn musician: suppose you go with me, and try what you can
do in the same way?’ The dog said he was willing, and they jogged on
together.

They had not gone far before they saw a cat sitting in the middle of the
road and making a most rueful face. ‘Pray, my good lady,’ said the ass,
‘what’s the matter with you? You look quite out of spirits!’ ‘Ah, me!’
said the cat, ‘how can one be in good spirits when one’s life is in
danger? Because I am beginning to grow old, and had rather lie at my
ease by the fire than run about the house after the mice, my mistress
laid hold of me, and was going to drown me; and though I have been lucky
enough to get away from her, I do not know what I am to live upon.’
‘Oh,’ said the ass, ‘by all means go with us to the great city; you are
a good night singer, and may make your fortune as a musician.’ The cat
was pleased with the thought, and joined the party.

Soon afterwards, as they were passing by a farmyard, they saw a cock
perched upon a gate, and screaming out with all his might and main.
‘Bravo!’ said the ass; ‘upon my word, you make a famous noise; pray what
is all this about?’ ‘Why,’ said the cock, ‘I was just now saying that
we should have fine weather for our washing-day, and yet my mistress and
the cook don’t thank me for my pains, but threaten to cut off my
head tomorrow, and make broth of me for the guests that are coming
on Sunday!’ ‘Heaven forbid!’ said the ass, ‘come with us Master
Chanticleer; it will be better, at any rate, than staying here to have
your head cut off! Besides, who knows? If we care to sing in tune, we
may get up some kind of a concert; so come along with us.’ ‘With all my
heart,’ said the cock: so they all four went on jollily together.

They could not, however, reach the great city the first day; so when
night came on, they went into a wood to sleep. The ass and the dog laid
themselves down under a great tree, and the cat climbed up into the
branches; while the cock, thinking that the higher he sat the safer he
should be, flew up to the very top of the tree, and then, according to
his custom, before he went to sleep, looked out on all sides of him to
see that everything was well. In doing this, he saw afar off something
bright and shining and calling to his companions said, ‘There must be a
house no great way off, for I see a light.’ ‘If that be the case,’ said
the ass, ‘we had better change our quarters, for our lodging is not the
best in the world!’ ‘Besides,’ added the dog, ‘I should not be the
worse for a bone or two, or a bit of meat.’ So they walked off together
towards the spot where Chanticleer had seen the light, and as they drew
near it became larger and brighter, till they at last came close to a
house in which a gang of robbers lived.

The ass, being the tallest of the company, marched up to the window and
peeped in. ‘Well, Donkey,’ said Chanticleer, ‘what do you see?’ ‘What
do I see?’ replied the ass. ‘Why, I see a table spread with all kinds of
good things, and robbers sitting round it making merry.’ ‘That would
be a noble lodging for us,’ said the cock. ‘Yes,’ said the ass, ‘if we
could only get in’; so they consulted together how they should contrive
to get the robbers out; and at last they hit upon a plan. The ass placed
himself upright on his hind legs, with his forefeet resting against the
window; the dog got upon his back; the cat scrambled up to the dog’s
shoulders, and the cock flew up and sat upon the cat’s head. When
all was ready a signal was given, and they began their music. The ass
brayed, the dog barked, the cat mewed, and the cock screamed; and then
they all broke through the window at once, and came tumbling into
the room, amongst the broken glass, with a most hideous clatter! The
robbers, who had been not a little frightened by the opening concert,
had now no doubt that some frightful hobgoblin had broken in upon them,
and scampered away as fast as they could.

The coast once clear, our travellers soon sat down and dispatched what
the robbers had left, with as much eagerness as if they had not expected
to eat again for a month. As soon as they had satisfied themselves, they
put out the lights, and each once more sought out a resting-place to
his own liking. The donkey laid himself down upon a heap of straw in
the yard, the dog stretched himself upon a mat behind the door, the
cat rolled herself up on the hearth before the warm ashes, and the
cock perched upon a beam on the top of the house; and, as they were all
rather tired with their journey, they soon fell asleep.

But about midnight, when the robbers saw from afar that the lights were
out and that all seemed quiet, they began to think that they had been in
too great a hurry to run away; and one of them, who was bolder than
the rest, went to see what was going on. Finding everything still, he
marched into the kitchen, and groped about till he found a match in
order to light a candle; and then, espying the glittering fiery eyes of
the cat, he mistook them for live coals, and held the match to them to
light it. But the cat, not understanding this joke, sprang at his face,
and spat, and scratched at him. This frightened him dreadfully, and away
he ran to the back door; but there the dog jumped up and bit him in the
leg; and as he was crossing over the yard the ass kicked him; and the
cock, who had been awakened by the noise, crowed with all his might. At
this the robber ran back as fast as he could to his comrades, and told
the captain how a horrid witch had got into the house, and had spat at
him and scratched his face with her long bony fingers; how a man with a
knife in his hand had hidden himself behind the door, and stabbed him
in the leg; how a black monster stood in the yard and struck him with a
club, and how the devil had sat upon the top of the house and cried out,
‘Throw the rascal up here!’ After this the robbers never dared to go
back to the house; but the musicians were so pleased with their quarters
that they took up their abode there; and there they are, I dare say, at
this very day.",1368,Bremenski_mestni_godci,"Imel je človek osla, ki je že leta in leta potrpežljivo vlačil vreče žita v mlin. A moči so mu začele pešati, tako da je bil čedalje manj sposoben za delo. In je prišlo gospodarju na misel, da bi ga nehal hraniti. Osel pa je zaduhal, da piha slab veter, pobegnil je in se odpravil v mesto Bremen. Upal je, da bo tam lahko dobil službo mestnega godca. Ko je nekaj časa tako koračil, je naletel na lovskega psa, ki je ležal na poti in sopel, kakor kdo, ki se je do smrti utrudil od tekanja. »Kaj pa tako sopeš, Grabavs?« ga vpraša osel. »Oh,« odvrne pes. »Star sem in vsak dan slabši, niti za lov nisem več. Ker me je gospodar hotel ubiti, sem jo ucvrl, zdaj pa ne vem, kako naj si zaslužim skorjico kruha?« »Veš kaj?« mu odvrne osel. »Jaz sem namenjen v Bremen, da postanem tam mestni godec. Jaz bom igral lutnjo, ti bi pa udarjal na boben.« Pes je bil zadovoljen in je šel z njim. Ni dolgo trajalo, kar sta srečala mačko, ki je čepela na poti in se nadvse kislo in čemerno držala. »Kaj pa ti gre tako narobe, Čohačka stara?« jo je vprašal osel. »Joj, joj, kdo pa bi bil vesel, če se mu grlo stiska?« je rekla mačka. »Ker sem prišla v leta in so se mi zobje skrhali ter rajši za pečjo sedim in predem, kakor pa bi lovila miši, me je hotela gospodinja utopiti. Jaz sem se ji sicer iztrgala, a zdaj mi je potreben dober svet: kam naj grem?« 

»Pojdi z nama v Bremen. Saj si mojster v nočni muziki tam lahko postaneš mestni godec.« Mački se je zdelo to pametno, pa je šla z njima. Nato so begunci prišli mimo nekega dvorišča; pred vrati je stal domači petelin in na vse pretege »Kaj pa se dereš, da reže v mozeg in v kosti?« mu je rekel osel. »Kaj hočeš s tem?« »Prerokoval sem lepo vreme,« je dejal petelin, »ker je jutri praznik in se mora perilo posušiti. Ker pa pridejo jutri gostje, nima gospodinja usmiljenja z menoj in je naročila kuharici, da me bo jutri v juhi pojedla in zato si moram že danes dati odrezati glavo. Zdaj se derem na vse grlo, dokler se še lahko.« »Eh, kaj, Rdečeglavček,« mu reče osel, »pojdi rajši z nami! V Bremen smo namenjeni, kaj boljšega kakor smrt povsod lahko najdeš. Lep glas imaš in če skupaj zaigramo, bo to odlična muzika.« Petelinu je bil predlog všeč in vsi štirje so odšli na pot. Vendar pa v enem dnevu niso mogli priti do mesta Bremen in tako so prišli zvečer v neki gozd, kjer so hoteli prenočiti. Osel in pes sta legla pod visoko drevo, mačka in petelin pa sta se spravila na veje, a petelin je zletel prav do vrha, kjer je bilo zanj najbolj varno. Preden je zaspal, se je še enkrat ozrl na vse štiri strani in zazdelo se mu je, da vidi v daljavi majhno iskrico, zaklical je tovarišem, da mora biti nedaleč od tod neka hiša, v kateri se nekaj svetlika. »Potemtakem se moramo dvigniti,« je rekel osel, »in oditi tja, ker imamo tukaj slabo prenočišče.« Pes je menil, da bi mu malo kosti z mesom ne delo slabo. Tako so se odpravili na pot proti kraju, od koder je prihajal svetloba. Videli so, da je luč čedalje večja, dokler niso prišli 

pred dobro razsvetljeno razbojniko hišo. Osel se je kot največji približal oknu in pogledal v hišo. »Kaj pa vidiš, Sivko?« je vprašal petelin. »Kaj vidim?« je odvrnil osel. »Lepo pogrnjeno mizo vidim • z dobrimi jedmi in pijačami. Okrog mize pa sede razbojniki in se mastijo.« »To bi bilo nekaj za nas,« je dejal petelin. »Saj, saj, oh, če bi bili mi tam notri,« je zavzdihnil osel. Nato so se začele živali posvetovati, kaj naj napravijo, da bi pregnale razbojnike iz hiše. Končno so se domislile. Osel se je moral s prednjimi parklji postaviti na okno, pes skočiti oslu na hrbet, mačka zlesti na psa in nazadnje je zletel petelin kvišku ter sedel mački na glavo. Potem so začeli na dano znamenje vsak svojo pesem: osel je rigal, pes lajal, mačka mijavkala in petelin zakikirikal. Nato so planili skozi okno v izbo, da so zažvenketale šipe. Razbojniki so ob strahovitem vrišču planili na noge, ker so mislili, da je prišla neka prikazen, ter so v silnem strahu pobegnili v gozd. Naši štirje prijatelji pa so sedli za mizo, se zadovoljili s tem, kar je ostalo, ter se tako natlačili, kakor da najmanj štiri tedne ne bojo imeli kaj dati v usta. Ko so se naši štirje godci nasitili, so utrnili luč in si poiskali vsak svoje ležišče, kakor se je komu prileglo in mu bilo pogodu. Osel je legel na gnoj, pes za vrata, mačka na ognjišče k toplemu pepelu in petelin na kurjo gredo. In ker so bili utrujeni od dolge poti, so kmalu tudi zaspali. Ko je minila polnoč in so roparji od daleč videli, da ni več luči v hiši in da je videti vse mirno, je rekel njihov kolovodja: »Ne bi se smeli pustiti tako hitro ugnati v kozji rog.« Poslal je enega razbojnika, naj pogleda in preišče hišo. Vse je bilo tiho. Stopil je v kuhinjo, da bi prižgal svečo. In ker je imel žareče, ognjene mačkine oči za tleče oglje, je primaknil k njim žveplenko, da bi jo prižgal. Mačka pa ni 

poznala šale. Skočila mu je v obraz ter ga začela praskati. Zelo se je razbojnik prestrašil, stekel je in hotel skozi dvoriščna vrata na dvorišče, pes pa, ki je ležal tam, je skočili in ga ugriznil v nogo. In ko je razbojnik oddirjal po dvorišču mimo gnoja, mu je dal še osel pošteno brco z zadnjo nogo. Petelin pa, ki ga je ves hrup prebudil iz spanja, se je zdramil, in na vse grlo zapel z grede: »Kikiriki!« Razbojnik je tekel, kolikor so ga nesle noge, k svojemu poglavarju in mu sporočil: »Hu, v tisti hiši gospodari neka grozovita čarovnica. Puhnila je vame in mi s svojimi dolgimi nohti razpraskala ves obraz. In pred vrati stoji nekdo z nožem, ki me je usekal v nogo, na dvorišču leži neka črna pošast, ki me je oplazila z lesenim betom, na strehi pa je sedel sodnik in vpil: ,Pripeljite mi lopova!' Zato sem pobegnil.« Od takrat si roparji niso več upali v hišo, štirim bremenskim godcem pa je bilo tako všeč v njej, da niso hoteli več ven. In če niso že umrli, živijo še dandanes. ",1088
1,OLD SULTAN,"A shepherd had a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old,
and had lost all his teeth. And one day when the shepherd and his wife
were standing together before the house the shepherd said, ‘I will shoot
old Sultan tomorrow morning, for he is of no use now.’ But his wife
said, ‘Pray let the poor faithful creature live; he has served us well a
great many years, and we ought to give him a livelihood for the rest of
his days.’ ‘But what can we do with him?’ said the shepherd, ‘he has not
a tooth in his head, and the thieves don’t care for him at all; to
be sure he has served us, but then he did it to earn his livelihood;
tomorrow shall be his last day, depend upon it.’

Poor Sultan, who was lying close by them, heard all that the shepherd
and his wife said to one another, and was very much frightened to think
tomorrow would be his last day; so in the evening he went to his good
friend the wolf, who lived in the wood, and told him all his sorrows,
and how his master meant to kill him in the morning. ‘Make yourself
easy,’ said the wolf, ‘I will give you some good advice. Your master,
you know, goes out every morning very early with his wife into the
field; and they take their little child with them, and lay it down
behind the hedge in the shade while they are at work. Now do you lie
down close by the child, and pretend to be watching it, and I will come
out of the wood and run away with it; you must run after me as fast as
you can, and I will let it drop; then you may carry it back, and they
will think you have saved their child, and will be so thankful to you
that they will take care of you as long as you live.’ The dog liked this
plan very well; and accordingly so it was managed. The wolf ran with the
child a little way; the shepherd and his wife screamed out; but Sultan
soon overtook him, and carried the poor little thing back to his master
and mistress. Then the shepherd patted him on the head, and said, ‘Old
Sultan has saved our child from the wolf, and therefore he shall live
and be well taken care of, and have plenty to eat. Wife, go home, and
give him a good dinner, and let him have my old cushion to sleep on
as long as he lives.’ So from this time forward Sultan had all that he
could wish for.

Soon afterwards the wolf came and wished him joy, and said, ‘Now, my
good fellow, you must tell no tales, but turn your head the other way
when I want to taste one of the old shepherd’s fine fat sheep.’ ‘No,’
said the Sultan; ‘I will be true to my master.’ However, the wolf
thought he was in joke, and came one night to get a dainty morsel. But
Sultan had told his master what the wolf meant to do; so he laid wait
for him behind the barn door, and when the wolf was busy looking out for
a good fat sheep, he had a stout cudgel laid about his back, that combed
his locks for him finely.

Then the wolf was very angry, and called Sultan ‘an old rogue,’ and
swore he would have his revenge. So the next morning the wolf sent the
boar to challenge Sultan to come into the wood to fight the matter. Now
Sultan had nobody he could ask to be his second but the shepherd’s old
three-legged cat; so he took her with him, and as the poor thing limped
along with some trouble, she stuck up her tail straight in the air.

The wolf and the wild boar were first on the ground; and when they
espied their enemies coming, and saw the cat’s long tail standing
straight in the air, they thought she was carrying a sword for Sultan to
fight with; and every time she limped, they thought she was picking up
a stone to throw at them; so they said they should not like this way of
fighting, and the boar lay down behind a bush, and the wolf jumped
up into a tree. Sultan and the cat soon came up, and looked about and
wondered that no one was there. The boar, however, had not quite hidden
himself, for his ears stuck out of the bush; and when he shook one of
them a little, the cat, seeing something move, and thinking it was a
mouse, sprang upon it, and bit and scratched it, so that the boar jumped
up and grunted, and ran away, roaring out, ‘Look up in the tree, there
sits the one who is to blame.’ So they looked up, and espied the wolf
sitting amongst the branches; and they called him a cowardly rascal,
and would not suffer him to come down till he was heartily ashamed of
himself, and had promised to be good friends again with old Sultan.",875,Stari_sultan,"Neki kmet je imel zvestega psa, ki mu je bilo ime Sultan. Pes pa se je postaral in zgubil je vse svoje zobe, tako da ni mogel več krepko zgrabiti. Nekega dne je stal kmet s svojo ženo pred hišnimi vrati in dejal: »Starega Sultana bom jutri ustrelil, ker ni več za rabo.« Ženi pa se je zvesta žival smilila in je rekla: »Toliko let nam je služil in zvesto držal z nami, lahko bi ga iz usmiljenja obdržala.« »Kje neki,« je rekel kmet, »saj si ob pamet. Niti enega zoba nima več, tatovi se ga ne bojijo, lahko ga pogrešamo. Če nam je služil, se je zato vsak dan dobro nažrl.« Ubogi pes, ki je ležal nedaleč od tod zleknjen na soncu, pa je vse to slišal. Žalosten je bil, ker je bil zanj naslednji dan njegov zadnji. Imel pa je dobrega starega znanca, volka, in k temu se je zvečer splazil ter mu potožil usodo, ki ga čaka. »Kar dobre volje bodi, Sultan,« je rekel volk, »jaz ti že pomagam iz stiske. Nekaj sem si izmislil. Jutri odide tvoj gospodar z ženo po seno. S seboj bosta vzela svojega malega otroka, ker ne bo nikogar doma. Navadno položita med delom otroka za seč v senco. Lezi ti zraven otroka, kakor da ga hočeš stražiti. Jaz pa se bom medtem priplazil iz gozda in ugrabil otroka. Ti moraš steči za menoj, kakor da mi ga hočeš iztrgati. Jaz ga bom spustil na tla, ti pa ga boš prinesel staršem nazaj. Mislila bosta, da si ga rešil in ti bosta veliko preveč 

hvaležna, da bi ti storila kaj žalega. Narobe, še v posebni milosti boš in ničesar več ne boš pogrešal.« Ta naklep je bil psu všeč. In kakor sta ga zasnovala, tako sta ga izvedla. Oče je zakričal, ko je zagledal volka, ki je tekel z otrokom, ko ga je pa stari Sultan prinesel nazaj, je bil neznansko vesel. Pobožal je psa in rekel: »Niti lasu ti ne bomo skrivili, obdržali te bomo in jedel boš, dokler boš živ.« Svoji ženi pa je dejal : »Pojdi precej domov in skuhaj staremu Sultanu mlečne kaše, ki je ni treba gristi. In prinesi še blazino z moje postelje, naj jo ima za svoje ležišče.« Od takrat naprej se je staremu Sultanu tako dobro godilo, kot si je le mogel želeti. Kmalu zatem ga je obiskal volk. Bil je vesel, da se je tako lepo posrečilo. »Ampak, Sultan,« je rekel, »saj boš menda zatisnil oko, če vzamem ob priložnosti tvojemu gospodarju kakšno rejeno ovco. Dandanes se je težko prebijati skozi življenje.« »S tem pa rajši ne računaj,« je odgovoril Sultan, »svojemu gospodarju ostanem zvest, v to ne smem privoliti.« Volk je menil, da ni resno govoril; priplazil se je ponoči in hotel ugrabiti ovco. Kmet pa, ki mu je zvesti Sultan izdal, kaj volk namerava, ga je pričakal in mu s cepcem kaj grdo počesal dlako. Volk je moral pobegniti. Spotoma pa je zaklical psu: »Le čakaj, mrcina pasja, to mi boš plačal!« Drugo jutro je volk poslal merjasca, da je pozval Sultana, naj pride v gozd, da bosta z volkom v dvoboju poravnala spor. Stari Sultan ni mogel najti druge priče kakor mačka, ki je imel samo še tri noge. In ko sta šla skupaj v gozd, je ubogi maček šantal, obenem pa zaradi bolečine visoko dvigal svoj rep. 

Volk in njegova priča sta bila že na mestu. Ko pa sta zagledala svojega nasprotnika, ki je prihajal, sta mislila, da prinaša sabljo s seboj, tak je bil videti mačkin dvignjeni rep. In ker je uboga žival poskakovala po treh nogah, sta bila prepričana, da Sultan vsakokrat pobere kak kamen, da ju bo obsul z njim. Tedaj je obema šinil strah v kosti: merjasec se je zaril v listje, volk pa je skočil na drevo. Ko sta pes in maček prišla tja, sta se začudila, da ni nikogar nikjer. Merjasec pa se ni mogel čisto skriti v listje, temveč so mu uhlji še moleli iz njega. Ko se je maček lagodno oziral okrog sebe, je zmignil merjasec z uhlji. Maček pa je mislil, da je švignila miška, skočil je in krepko ugriznil v uho. Merjasec je zarjul od bolečine, planil, stekel in zavpil: »Tamle na drevesu se skriva pravi krivec!« Pes in maček sta pogledala na drevo in opazila volka, ki ga je bilo sram, da se je pokazal takega strahopetca. In volk je sprejel mir, ki mu ga je ponudil Sultan.

2,THE DOG AND THE SPARROW,"A shepherd’s dog had a master who took no care of him, but often let him
suffer the greatest hunger. At last he could bear it no longer; so he
took to his heels, and off he ran in a very sad and sorrowful mood.
On the road he met a sparrow that said to him, ‘Why are you so sad,
my friend?’ ‘Because,’ said the dog, ‘I am very very hungry, and have
nothing to eat.’ ‘If that be all,’ answered the sparrow, ‘come with me
into the next town, and I will soon find you plenty of food.’ So on they
went together into the town: and as they passed by a butcher’s shop,
the sparrow said to the dog, ‘Stand there a little while till I peck you
down a piece of meat.’ So the sparrow perched upon the shelf: and having
first looked carefully about her to see if anyone was watching her, she
pecked and scratched at a steak that lay upon the edge of the shelf,
till at last down it fell. Then the dog snapped it up, and scrambled
away with it into a corner, where he soon ate it all up. ‘Well,’ said
the sparrow, ‘you shall have some more if you will; so come with me to
the next shop, and I will peck you down another steak.’ When the dog had
eaten this too, the sparrow said to him, ‘Well, my good friend, have you
had enough now?’ ‘I have had plenty of meat,’ answered he, ‘but I should
like to have a piece of bread to eat after it.’ ‘Come with me then,’
said the sparrow, ‘and you shall soon have that too.’ So she took him
to a baker’s shop, and pecked at two rolls that lay in the window, till
they fell down: and as the dog still wished for more, she took him to
another shop and pecked down some more for him. When that was eaten, the
sparrow asked him whether he had had enough now. ‘Yes,’ said he; ‘and
now let us take a walk a little way out of the town.’ So they both went
out upon the high road; but as the weather was warm, they had not gone
far before the dog said, ‘I am very much tired--I should like to take a
nap.’ ‘Very well,’ answered the sparrow, ‘do so, and in the meantime
I will perch upon that bush.’ So the dog stretched himself out on the
road, and fell fast asleep. Whilst he slept, there came by a carter with
a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine. The
sparrow, seeing that the carter did not turn out of the way, but would
go on in the track in which the dog lay, so as to drive over him, called
out, ‘Stop! stop! Mr Carter, or it shall be the worse for you.’ But the
carter, grumbling to himself, ‘You make it the worse for me, indeed!
what can you do?’ cracked his whip, and drove his cart over the poor
dog, so that the wheels crushed him to death. ‘There,’ cried the
sparrow, ‘thou cruel villain, thou hast killed my friend the dog. Now
mind what I say. This deed of thine shall cost thee all thou art worth.’
‘Do your worst, and welcome,’ said the brute, ‘what harm can you do me?’
and passed on. But the sparrow crept under the tilt of the cart, and
pecked at the bung of one of the casks till she loosened it; and then
all the wine ran out, without the carter seeing it. At last he looked
round, and saw that the cart was dripping, and the cask quite empty.
‘What an unlucky wretch I am!’ cried he. ‘Not wretch enough yet!’ said
the sparrow, as she alighted upon the head of one of the horses, and
pecked at him till he reared up and kicked. When the carter saw this,
he drew out his hatchet and aimed a blow at the sparrow, meaning to kill
her; but she flew away, and the blow fell upon the poor horse’s head
with such force, that he fell down dead. ‘Unlucky wretch that I am!’
cried he. ‘Not wretch enough yet!’ said the sparrow. And as the carter
went on with the other two horses, she again crept under the tilt of the
cart, and pecked out the bung of the second cask, so that all the wine
ran out. When the carter saw this, he again cried out, ‘Miserable wretch
that I am!’ But the sparrow answered, ‘Not wretch enough yet!’ and
perched on the head of the second horse, and pecked at him too. The
carter ran up and struck at her again with his hatchet; but away she
flew, and the blow fell upon the second horse and killed him on the
spot. ‘Unlucky wretch that I am!’ said he. ‘Not wretch enough yet!’ said
the sparrow; and perching upon the third horse, she began to peck him
too. The carter was mad with fury; and without looking about him, or
caring what he was about, struck again at the sparrow; but killed his
third horse as he done the other two. ‘Alas! miserable wretch that I
am!’ cried he. ‘Not wretch enough yet!’ answered the sparrow as she flew
away; ‘now will I plague and punish thee at thy own house.’ The
carter was forced at last to leave his cart behind him, and to go home
overflowing with rage and vexation. ‘Alas!’ said he to his wife, ‘what
ill luck has befallen me!--my wine is all spilt, and my horses all three
dead.’ ‘Alas! husband,’ replied she, ‘and a wicked bird has come into
the house, and has brought with her all the birds in the world, I am
sure, and they have fallen upon our corn in the loft, and are eating it
up at such a rate!’ Away ran the husband upstairs, and saw thousands of
birds sitting upon the floor eating up his corn, with the sparrow in the
midst of them. ‘Unlucky wretch that I am!’ cried the carter; for he saw
that the corn was almost all gone. ‘Not wretch enough yet!’ said the
sparrow; ‘thy cruelty shall cost thee thy life yet!’ and away she flew.

The carter seeing that he had thus lost all that he had, went down
into his kitchen; and was still not sorry for what he had done, but sat
himself angrily and sulkily in the chimney corner. But the sparrow sat
on the outside of the window, and cried ‘Carter! thy cruelty shall cost
thee thy life!’ With that he jumped up in a rage, seized his hatchet,
and threw it at the sparrow; but it missed her, and only broke the
window. The sparrow now hopped in, perched upon the window-seat, and
cried, ‘Carter! it shall cost thee thy life!’ Then he became mad and
blind with rage, and struck the window-seat with such force that he
cleft it in two: and as the sparrow flew from place to place, the carter
and his wife were so furious, that they broke all their furniture,
glasses, chairs, benches, the table, and at last the walls, without
touching the bird at all. In the end, however, they caught her: and the
wife said, ‘Shall I kill her at once?’ ‘No,’ cried he, ‘that is letting
her off too easily: she shall die a much more cruel death; I will eat
her.’ But the sparrow began to flutter about, and stretch out her neck
and cried, ‘Carter! it shall cost thee thy life yet!’ With that he
could wait no longer: so he gave his wife the hatchet, and cried, ‘Wife,
strike at the bird and kill her in my hand.’ And the wife struck; but
she missed her aim, and hit her husband on the head so that he fell down
dead, and the sparrow flew quietly home to her nest.",1350,Pes_in_vrabec,"Neki ovčarski pes ni imel dobrega gospodarja, ampak tako slabega, da je stradal pri njem. Ko ni mogel več vzdržati, je odšel ves žalosten po svetu. Na cesti ga je srečal vrabec in ga vprašal: »Kaj pa ti je, bratec kosmati, da si tako žalosten?« »Lačen sem,« je rekel pes, »in nimam kaj jesti.« »Pojdi z menoj, brate, v mesto, pa se boš nasitil,« je dejal vrabec. Tako sta šla skupaj v mesto in ko sta prišla pred mesnico, je vrabec dejal psu: »Ostani tukaj, odkljuval ti bom kos mesa.« In zletel je na mizo, pogledal okrog sebe, ali ga kdo vidi ter začel kljuvati kos mesa in ga vleči sem in tja, dokler ni kos, ki je ležal na robu, zdrsnil in padel na tla. Pes ga je pograbil, stekel v kot in ga požrl. »Pojdiva zdaj v drugo mesnico,« je rekel vrabec, »poskrbel ti bom še en kos, da se boš do sitega najedel.« Ko je pes pogoltnil tudi drugi kos, ga je vrabec vprašal: »Bratec, si zdaj sit?« »Mesa sem sit,« je odgovoril pes, »a kruha še nisem dobil.« »Tudi kruha dobiš, kar z menoj pojdi.« Vrabec ga je odvedel v pekarno in je začel kljuvati tam, dokler se ni skotalilo nekaj hlebčkov na tla. In ko je pes želel še več, ga je povedel še v drugo pekarno in mu priskrbel še kruh. Ko je pes požrl, ga je vprašal: »Bratec kosmatin, si zdaj sit?« »Sem,« je odgovoril pes, »zdaj pa pojdiva malo iz mesta.« 

In odšla sta iz mesta na glavno cesto. Bilo pa je zelo vroče in ko sta prehodila košček poti, je pes dejal: »Truden sem in rad bi malo zaspal.« »No, kar zaspi, jaz pa sedem ta čas na vejico.« Pes je legel sredi ceste in trdno zaspal. Ko pa je ležal tam in spal, je pripeljal po cesti voznik z vozom, v katerega so bili vpreženi trije konji. Na vozu sta bila dva soda vina. Ko je vrabec videl, da se voznik noče umakniti in da vozi kar po kolovozu, kjer je ležal pes, mu je vzkliknil: »Nikar tega, voznik, nesrečnega te bom storil!« »Ti me že ne boš storil nesrečnega,« je zagodrnjal voznik predse, počil z bičem in pognal voz čez psa, da ga je povozil. »Povozil si mi brata kosmatina,« je zavpil tedaj vrabec, »to boš plačal z vozom in s konji.« »Saj, z vozom in s konji,« je posmehljivo rekel voznik, »kje bi mi mogel ti škodovati.« Voznik je peljal dalje, vrabec pa je zlezel pod ponjavo na vozu ter začel kljuvati čep na sodu in je kljuval tako dolgo, da ga je prekljuval in je steklo vse vino iz soda, ne da bi bil voznik kaj opazil. Ko pa je le pogledal nazaj, je videl, da kaplja z voza; pregledal je sode in — eden je bil prazen. »o, jaz nesrečnež!« je zatarnal. »Nisi še zadosti nesrečen!« je odgovoril vrabec in poletel konju na glavo ter mu izkljuval oči. Ko voznik to vidi, potegne sekiro, da bi zadel vrabca z njo, vrabec pa je odletel v zrak in voznik je zadel svojega konja po glavi, da se je mrtev zgrudil. »Oj, jaz nesrečnež!« je zastokal voznik. »Ne, nisi še zadosti nesrečen!« je dejal vrabec. In ko je voznik z dvema konjema peljal dalje, je vrabec zlezel pod ponjavo in izkljuval čep še pri drugem sodu, da je vse izteklo iz njega. 

Ko voznik to opazi, znova zastoka: »Joj, jaz nesrečnež!« »Nisi še zadosti nesrečen!« mu odgovori vrabec, sede drugemu konju na glavo in mu izkljuje oči. Voznik skoči k njemu in zamahne s sekiro po njem, vrabec pa sfrči kvišku in voznik zadene konja in ga ubije. »Joj, jaz nesrečnež!« »Nisi še zadosti nesrečen,« reče vrabec, sede še tretjemu konju na glavo in začne kljuvati oči. Voznik pa je kakor slep od jeze zamahnil proti vrabcu, ne da bi pazil, a ga ni zadel, marveč je ubil še svojega tretjega konja. »Jojmene, kako sem nesrečen!« zakriči voznik. »Ne, nisi še zadosti nesrečen, onesrečil te bom šele doma,« zagrozi vrabec in odleti. Voznik je moral pustiti voz na cesti in hud in jezen oditi domov. »Ah,« je rekel svoji ženi, »glej kakšna nesreča me je doletela! Vino mi je izteklo iz sodov in vsi trije konji so mrtvi.« »Oh, mož,« je rekla žena možu, »kakšen hudoben ptič je prišel v hišo! Zbral je vse ptice sveta in so se vrgli gori na našo pšenico in bojo vso pozobali.« Voznik je odšel na podstrešje, tam pa je sedelo na tisoče in tisoče ptic in pozobale so vso pšenico; med njimi je bil tudi vrabec. »Joj, kako sem nesrečen!« je ves potrt zavzdihnil voznik. »Ne, nisi še zadosti nesrečen, še s svojim življenjem boš plačal,« je vzkliknil vrabec in odfrčal. Tako je voznik izgubil vse svoje imetje. Žalosten je odšel v hišo, sedel za peč in bil hud in razkačen. Pred oknom pa je sedel vrabec in mu vreščal: »Plačal boš s svojim življenjem!« Voznik je pograbil sekiro in jo zalučal v vrabca; sekira je razbila šipe v oknih, ptice pa ni zadela. Vrabec je priletel nato v izbo, sedel na peč in vreščal: »Plačal boš s svojim življenjem!« 

Voznik pa, ves besen in slep od togote, je razbil peč in tako še vse drugo, kamor koli je sedel vrabec, iz kraja v kraj, vse svoje pohištvo, zrcalo, klopi, mizo in nazadnje še stene svoje hiše, njega pa ni mogel zadeti. Nazadnje ga le pograbi z roko. »Ali naj ga ubijem?« vpraša njegova žena. »Ne,« vzklikne on, »to bi bila premila kazen. Hujše smrti naj umre, požrl ga bom!« Vzel je ptiča in ga pogoltnil. Vrabec pa mu začne frfotati v želodcu, prifrfota kvišku, vozniku v usta. Tam pokuka z glavo ven in zakliče: »Pa boš vendarle plačal z življenjem!« Voznik da sekiro svoji ženi in ji reče: »Ubij mi vrabca v ustih!« Žena udari, udarec pa je zgrešil in zadel voznika naravnost na glavo, da se je mrtev zgrudil na tla. Vrabec pa se je dvignil in odletel.

3,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"Hard by a great forest dwelt a poor wood-cutter with his wife and his
two children. The boy was called Hansel and the girl Gretel. He had
little to bite and to break, and once when great dearth fell on the
land, he could no longer procure even daily bread. Now when he thought
over this by night in his bed, and tossed about in his anxiety, he
groaned and said to his wife: ‘What is to become of us? How are we
to feed our poor children, when we no longer have anything even for
ourselves?’ ‘I’ll tell you what, husband,’ answered the woman, ‘early
tomorrow morning we will take the children out into the forest to where
it is the thickest; there we will light a fire for them, and give each
of them one more piece of bread, and then we will go to our work and
leave them alone. They will not find the way home again, and we shall be
rid of them.’ ‘No, wife,’ said the man, ‘I will not do that; how can I
bear to leave my children alone in the forest?--the wild animals would
soon come and tear them to pieces.’ ‘O, you fool!’ said she, ‘then we
must all four die of hunger, you may as well plane the planks for our
coffins,’ and she left him no peace until he consented. ‘But I feel very
sorry for the poor children, all the same,’ said the man.

The two children had also not been able to sleep for hunger, and had
heard what their stepmother had said to their father. Gretel wept
bitter tears, and said to Hansel: ‘Now all is over with us.’ ‘Be quiet,
Gretel,’ said Hansel, ‘do not distress yourself, I will soon find a way
to help us.’ And when the old folks had fallen asleep, he got up, put
on his little coat, opened the door below, and crept outside. The moon
shone brightly, and the white pebbles which lay in front of the house
glittered like real silver pennies. Hansel stooped and stuffed the
little pocket of his coat with as many as he could get in. Then he went
back and said to Gretel: ‘Be comforted, dear little sister, and sleep in
peace, God will not forsake us,’ and he lay down again in his bed. When
day dawned, but before the sun had risen, the woman came and awoke the
two children, saying: ‘Get up, you sluggards! we are going into the
forest to fetch wood.’ She gave each a little piece of bread, and said:
‘There is something for your dinner, but do not eat it up before then,
for you will get nothing else.’ Gretel took the bread under her apron,
as Hansel had the pebbles in his pocket. Then they all set out together
on the way to the forest. When they had walked a short time, Hansel
stood still and peeped back at the house, and did so again and again.
His father said: ‘Hansel, what are you looking at there and staying
behind for? Pay attention, and do not forget how to use your legs.’ ‘Ah,
father,’ said Hansel, ‘I am looking at my little white cat, which is
sitting up on the roof, and wants to say goodbye to me.’ The wife said:
‘Fool, that is not your little cat, that is the morning sun which is
shining on the chimneys.’ Hansel, however, had not been looking back at
the cat, but had been constantly throwing one of the white pebble-stones
out of his pocket on the road.

When they had reached the middle of the forest, the father said: ‘Now,
children, pile up some wood, and I will light a fire that you may not
be cold.’ Hansel and Gretel gathered brushwood together, as high as a
little hill. The brushwood was lighted, and when the flames were burning
very high, the woman said: ‘Now, children, lay yourselves down by the
fire and rest, we will go into the forest and cut some wood. When we
have done, we will come back and fetch you away.’

Hansel and Gretel sat by the fire, and when noon came, each ate a little
piece of bread, and as they heard the strokes of the wood-axe they
believed that their father was near. It was not the axe, however, but
a branch which he had fastened to a withered tree which the wind was
blowing backwards and forwards. And as they had been sitting such a long
time, their eyes closed with fatigue, and they fell fast asleep. When
at last they awoke, it was already dark night. Gretel began to cry and
said: ‘How are we to get out of the forest now?’ But Hansel comforted
her and said: ‘Just wait a little, until the moon has risen, and then we
will soon find the way.’ And when the full moon had risen, Hansel took
his little sister by the hand, and followed the pebbles which shone like
newly-coined silver pieces, and showed them the way.

They walked the whole night long, and by break of day came once more
to their father’s house. They knocked at the door, and when the woman
opened it and saw that it was Hansel and Gretel, she said: ‘You naughty
children, why have you slept so long in the forest?--we thought you were
never coming back at all!’ The father, however, rejoiced, for it had cut
him to the heart to leave them behind alone.

Not long afterwards, there was once more great dearth throughout the
land, and the children heard their mother saying at night to their
father: ‘Everything is eaten again, we have one half loaf left, and that
is the end. The children must go, we will take them farther into the
wood, so that they will not find their way out again; there is no other
means of saving ourselves!’ The man’s heart was heavy, and he thought:
‘It would be better for you to share the last mouthful with your
children.’ The woman, however, would listen to nothing that he had to
say, but scolded and reproached him. He who says A must say B, likewise,
and as he had yielded the first time, he had to do so a second time
also.

The children, however, were still awake and had heard the conversation.
When the old folks were asleep, Hansel again got up, and wanted to go
out and pick up pebbles as he had done before, but the woman had locked
the door, and Hansel could not get out. Nevertheless he comforted his
little sister, and said: ‘Do not cry, Gretel, go to sleep quietly, the
good God will help us.’

Early in the morning came the woman, and took the children out of their
beds. Their piece of bread was given to them, but it was still smaller
than the time before. On the way into the forest Hansel crumbled his
in his pocket, and often stood still and threw a morsel on the ground.
‘Hansel, why do you stop and look round?’ said the father, ‘go on.’ ‘I
am looking back at my little pigeon which is sitting on the roof, and
wants to say goodbye to me,’ answered Hansel. ‘Fool!’ said the woman,
‘that is not your little pigeon, that is the morning sun that is shining
on the chimney.’ Hansel, however little by little, threw all the crumbs
on the path.

The woman led the children still deeper into the forest, where they had
never in their lives been before. Then a great fire was again made, and
the mother said: ‘Just sit there, you children, and when you are tired
you may sleep a little; we are going into the forest to cut wood, and in
the evening when we are done, we will come and fetch you away.’ When
it was noon, Gretel shared her piece of bread with Hansel, who had
scattered his by the way. Then they fell asleep and evening passed, but
no one came to the poor children. They did not awake until it was dark
night, and Hansel comforted his little sister and said: ‘Just wait,
Gretel, until the moon rises, and then we shall see the crumbs of bread
which I have strewn about, they will show us our way home again.’ When
the moon came they set out, but they found no crumbs, for the many
thousands of birds which fly about in the woods and fields had picked
them all up. Hansel said to Gretel: ‘We shall soon find the way,’ but
they did not find it. They walked the whole night and all the next day
too from morning till evening, but they did not get out of the forest,
and were very hungry, for they had nothing to eat but two or three
berries, which grew on the ground. And as they were so weary that their
legs would carry them no longer, they lay down beneath a tree and fell
asleep.

It was now three mornings since they had left their father’s house. They
began to walk again, but they always came deeper into the forest, and if
help did not come soon, they must die of hunger and weariness. When it
was mid-day, they saw a beautiful snow-white bird sitting on a bough,
which sang so delightfully that they stood still and listened to it. And
when its song was over, it spread its wings and flew away before them,
and they followed it until they reached a little house, on the roof of
which it alighted; and when they approached the little house they saw
that it was built of bread and covered with cakes, but that the windows
were of clear sugar. ‘We will set to work on that,’ said Hansel, ‘and
have a good meal. I will eat a bit of the roof, and you Gretel, can eat
some of the window, it will taste sweet.’ Hansel reached up above, and
broke off a little of the roof to try how it tasted, and Gretel leant
against the window and nibbled at the panes. Then a soft voice cried
from the parlour:

 ‘Nibble, nibble, gnaw,
  Who is nibbling at my little house?’

The children answered:

 ‘The wind, the wind,
  The heaven-born wind,’

and went on eating without disturbing themselves. Hansel, who liked the
taste of the roof, tore down a great piece of it, and Gretel pushed out
the whole of one round window-pane, sat down, and enjoyed herself with
it. Suddenly the door opened, and a woman as old as the hills, who
supported herself on crutches, came creeping out. Hansel and Gretel were
so terribly frightened that they let fall what they had in their
hands. The old woman, however, nodded her head, and said: ‘Oh, you dear
children, who has brought you here? do come in, and stay with me. No
harm shall happen to you.’ She took them both by the hand, and led them
into her little house. Then good food was set before them, milk and
pancakes, with sugar, apples, and nuts. Afterwards two pretty little
beds were covered with clean white linen, and Hansel and Gretel lay down
in them, and thought they were in heaven.

The old woman had only pretended to be so kind; she was in reality
a wicked witch, who lay in wait for children, and had only built the
little house of bread in order to entice them there. When a child fell
into her power, she killed it, cooked and ate it, and that was a feast
day with her. Witches have red eyes, and cannot see far, but they have
a keen scent like the beasts, and are aware when human beings draw near.
When Hansel and Gretel came into her neighbourhood, she laughed with
malice, and said mockingly: ‘I have them, they shall not escape me
again!’ Early in the morning before the children were awake, she was
already up, and when she saw both of them sleeping and looking so
pretty, with their plump and rosy cheeks she muttered to herself: ‘That
will be a dainty mouthful!’ Then she seized Hansel with her shrivelled
hand, carried him into a little stable, and locked him in behind a
grated door. Scream as he might, it would not help him. Then she went to
Gretel, shook her till she awoke, and cried: ‘Get up, lazy thing, fetch
some water, and cook something good for your brother, he is in the
stable outside, and is to be made fat. When he is fat, I will eat him.’
Gretel began to weep bitterly, but it was all in vain, for she was
forced to do what the wicked witch commanded.

And now the best food was cooked for poor Hansel, but Gretel got nothing
but crab-shells. Every morning the woman crept to the little stable, and
cried: ‘Hansel, stretch out your finger that I may feel if you will soon
be fat.’ Hansel, however, stretched out a little bone to her, and
the old woman, who had dim eyes, could not see it, and thought it was
Hansel’s finger, and was astonished that there was no way of fattening
him. When four weeks had gone by, and Hansel still remained thin, she
was seized with impatience and would not wait any longer. ‘Now, then,
Gretel,’ she cried to the girl, ‘stir yourself, and bring some water.
Let Hansel be fat or lean, tomorrow I will kill him, and cook him.’ Ah,
how the poor little sister did lament when she had to fetch the water,
and how her tears did flow down her cheeks! ‘Dear God, do help us,’ she
cried. ‘If the wild beasts in the forest had but devoured us, we should
at any rate have died together.’ ‘Just keep your noise to yourself,’
said the old woman, ‘it won’t help you at all.’

Early in the morning, Gretel had to go out and hang up the cauldron with
the water, and light the fire. ‘We will bake first,’ said the old woman,
‘I have already heated the oven, and kneaded the dough.’ She pushed poor
Gretel out to the oven, from which flames of fire were already darting.
‘Creep in,’ said the witch, ‘and see if it is properly heated, so that
we can put the bread in.’ And once Gretel was inside, she intended to
shut the oven and let her bake in it, and then she would eat her, too.
But Gretel saw what she had in mind, and said: ‘I do not know how I am
to do it; how do I get in?’ ‘Silly goose,’ said the old woman. ‘The door
is big enough; just look, I can get in myself!’ and she crept up and
thrust her head into the oven. Then Gretel gave her a push that drove
her far into it, and shut the iron door, and fastened the bolt. Oh! then
she began to howl quite horribly, but Gretel ran away and the godless
witch was miserably burnt to death.

Gretel, however, ran like lightning to Hansel, opened his little stable,
and cried: ‘Hansel, we are saved! The old witch is dead!’ Then Hansel
sprang like a bird from its cage when the door is opened. How they did
rejoice and embrace each other, and dance about and kiss each other! And
as they had no longer any need to fear her, they went into the witch’s
house, and in every corner there stood chests full of pearls and jewels.
‘These are far better than pebbles!’ said Hansel, and thrust into his
pockets whatever could be got in, and Gretel said: ‘I, too, will take
something home with me,’ and filled her pinafore full. ‘But now we must
be off,’ said Hansel, ‘that we may get out of the witch’s forest.’

When they had walked for two hours, they came to a great stretch of
water. ‘We cannot cross,’ said Hansel, ‘I see no foot-plank, and no
bridge.’ ‘And there is also no ferry,’ answered Gretel, ‘but a white
duck is swimming there: if I ask her, she will help us over.’ Then she
cried:

 ‘Little duck, little duck, dost thou see,
  Hansel and Gretel are waiting for thee?
  There’s never a plank, or bridge in sight,
  Take us across on thy back so white.’

The duck came to them, and Hansel seated himself on its back, and told
his sister to sit by him. ‘No,’ replied Gretel, ‘that will be too heavy
for the little duck; she shall take us across, one after the other.’ The
good little duck did so, and when they were once safely across and had
walked for a short time, the forest seemed to be more and more familiar
to them, and at length they saw from afar their father’s house. Then
they began to run, rushed into the parlour, and threw themselves round
their father’s neck. The man had not known one happy hour since he had
left the children in the forest; the woman, however, was dead. Gretel
emptied her pinafore until pearls and precious stones ran about the
room, and Hansel threw one handful after another out of his pocket to
add to them. Then all anxiety was at an end, and they lived together
in perfect happiness. My tale is done, there runs a mouse; whosoever
catches it, may make himself a big fur cap out of it.",2952,Janko_in_Metka,"Na robu nekega velikega gozda je živel reven drvar s svojo ženo in z dvema otrokoma. Fantku je bilo ime Janko in dekletcu Metka. Drvarjeva družina že tako ni imela kdo ve kaj jesti, ko pa je nastopilo nerodovitno leto, ni mogel drvar zaslužiti niti vsakdanjega kruha. Ko je tako ponoči premišljeval v svoji postelji in se od skrbi premetaval, je vzdihnil in dejal svoji ženi: »Kaj bo z nami? Kako naj preživiva svoja uboga otroka, ko še zase nimava ničesar več?« »Veš kaj, mož,« je odgovorila žena, »jutri navsezgodaj od- peljiva otroka v gozd v najgostejšo goščo. Tam zakuriva ogenj in dajva vsakemu še košček kruha, nato pa se odpraviva na svoje delo in ju pustiva sama. Tako ne bosta več našla poti domov in se jih bova odkrižala.« »Ne, žena,« je rekel mož, »tega ne bom storil. Srce mi ne da, da bi puščal otroka sama v gozdu. Saj pridejo divje zveri in ju raztrgajo.« »O, ti bedak,« je rekla na to žena, »po tvojem naj potemtakem vsi štirje od lakote umremo. Ostane nam samo to, da izoblaš deske za mrtvaške krste.« In mu ni dala miru, dokler ni pristal. »Uboga otroka pa se mi vseeno smilita!« je dejal mož. Tudi lačna otroka nista mogla zaspati in sta slišala, kaj je mačeha rekla očetu. Metka je bridko zajokala in rekla Janku: »To je najin konec!«
»Tiho, Metka,« je rekel Janko, »nič ne skrbi, jaz si bom že kaj izmislil za naju.« In ko sta stara dva zaspala, je vstal, oblekel svoj suknjič, odprl zunanja vrata in se splazil ven. Mesec je jasno svetil in belo kamenje, ki je ležalo pred kočo, je sijalo kakor sami srebrniki. Janko se je sklonil in si vse žepe natlačil s kamenčki. Nato je šel nazaj v hišo in dejal Metki: »Nič ne skrbi, draga sestrica, kar mirno zaspi, vse bo še dobro.« In je legel nazaj v svojo posteljo. Zgodaj zjutraj, še preden je vzšlo sonce, je že prišla mačeha in zbudila otroka: »Vstanita, lenuha, v gozd grerilo po drva.« Nato je dala vsakemu košček kruha in rekla: »Tu imata nekaj za kosilo, a ne pojejta takoj, ker ne dobita nič drugega.« Metka je dala kruh pod prepasnik, ker je imel Janko vse žepe natlačene s kamenčki. Nato so se vsi štirje odpravili na pot proti gozdu. Ko so že nekaj časa hodili, se je Janko ustavil in se oziral nazaj proti hiši. Tako se je ustavljal in oziral venomer. »Kaj pa se kar naprej ustavljaš in zijaš nazaj, Janko? Pazi in ne pozabi na svoje noge,« je rekel oče. »Oh, oče,« je dejal deček, »po svoji beli mucki se oziram. Ta sedi na strehi in se poslavlja od mene.« »Bedak,« je rekla mati, »to ni tvoja bela mačka, to je jutranje sonce, ki sije na dimnik.« Janko pa se ni oziral po mački, temveč je vsakič vrgel na pot po en svetal kamenček iz žepa. Ko so prišli v sredo gozda, je dejal oče: »Naberita drv, otroka, zakuril bom ogenj, da vaju ne bo zeblo.« Janko in Metka sta nanosila celo goro dračja. Prižgali so ga in ko je ogenj visoko vzplapolal, je rekla ženska: »Zdaj pa lezita k ognju, otroka, in se odpočijta, midva z očetom greva v gozd sekat les. Ko opraviva, se vrneva po vaju.«
 Janko in Metka sta sedela ob ognju in ko je bilo poldne, sta pojedla vsak svoj košček kruha. Ves čas sta slišala udarce sekire in bilo je, kakor da seka oče nekje v bližini. To pa ni bila sekira, marveč veja, ki jo je oče privezal ob trhlo drevo in je v vetru udarjala sem in tja. Otroka sta tako dolgo sedela ob ognju, da so se jima od utrujenosti začele zapirati oči. Trdno sta zaspala. Ko sta se zbudila, je bila že črna noč. Metka je začela jokati in je rekla : »Kako prideva zdaj iz tega gozda?« »Samo majceno počakaj,« jo je tolažil Janko. »Ko vzide mesec, bova že našla pot.« Ko se je prikazala luna na nebu, je Janko prijel sestrico za roko in šel za kamenčki, ki so se iskrili kakor novo kovani srebrniki in jima kazali pot. Hodila sta vso noč in prišla šele v svitu naslednjega dne spet do domače hiše. Potrkala sta na vrata in ko je ženska odprla in videla, da sta onadva, je rekla: »Otroka malopridna, kaj pa sta tako dolgo spala v hosti. Z očetom sva že mislila, da se nočeta vrniti.« Oče pa se ju je razveselil, kajti v srcu ga je grizlo, da ju je bil pustil tako sama. Minilo je nekaj časa, pa je spet iz vseh kotov pritisnilo pomanjkanje. In otroka sta slišala, kako je mačeha rekla ponoči očetu v postelji : »Spet nam je pošel ves živež, samo pol hlebca kruha še imamo, potlej bo pesmi konec. Otroka morata z doma. Odvedla ju bova še globlje v gozd, da ne bosta našla več poti iz njega. Drugače ni rešitve za naju.« Drvarju je bilo težko pri srcu in pomislil je: »Bolje bi bilo, da bi zadnji grižljaj delil s svojima otrokoma.«
 Toda pri ženski je bilo bob ob steno vse, kar je dejal. Oštevala ga je in ga obsipala z očitki. In ko je drvar že enkrat pristal, je moral še drugič. Otroka pa sta bila budna in sta slišala ves ta pomenek. Ko sta stara dva zaspala, je Janko spet vstal, hotel ven po kamenčke kakor zadnjikrat, toda ženska je zaklenila vrata in Janko ni mogel iz hiše. Vseeno pa je pomiril sestrico, ki je jokala: »Nič ne jokaj, Metka, kar mirno spi. Vse bo še dobro.« Navsezgodaj je prišla mačeha in vrgla otroka iz postelje. Dobila sta vsak svoj košček kruha, ki pa je bil še manjši kakor zadnjikrat. Na poti proti gozdu je Janko drobil kruh v žepu, se večkrat ustavil in vrgel drobtinico na pot. »Kaj pa se ustavljaš, Janko, in gledaš nazaj?« je rekel oče. »Pojdi svojo pot.« »Po svojem golobčku se oziram, ki sedi na strehi in se hoče posloviti od mene,« je odgovoril Janko. »Bedak,« je rekla ženska, »to ni tvoj golob, to je jutranje sonce, ki sije na dimnik.« Janko pa je polagoma zmetal vse drobtinice na pot. Mačeha je odvedla otroka še globlje v gozd, v tako goščo, kakršne še živ dan nista videla. Tam so spet zakurili velik ogenj in mačeha je rekla: »Kar lepo sedita tukaj, otroka, in če bosta trudna, lahko malo zaspita. Z očetom greva v gozd sekat les, in zvečer, ko opraviva svoje delo, prideva po vaju.« Opoldne je Metka delila svoj košček kruha z Jankom, ki je svojega raztrosil po poti. Nato sta zaspala. Minil je že večer, k ubogima otrokoma pa ni bilo žive duše. Prebudila sta se šele v črni noči in Janko je miril svojo sestrico in ji rekel: »Kar počakaj, Metka, da je miril svojo sestrico in ji rekel: »Kar počakaj, Metka, da
vzide mesec. Potlej bova lahko videla drobtinice, ki sem jih natrosil, da nama pokažejo pot domov.« Ko je vzšla luna, sta se odpravila, a nobene drobtinice ni bilo več na poti, kajti tisoč in tisoč ptic, ki so letale po gozdu in po polju, jih je pozobalo. »Tudi tako bova našla pot,« je rekel Janko Metki. A nista je našla. Hodila sta vso noč in še cel dan od jutra do večera, a nista prišla iz gozda. Bila sta zelo lačna, ker nista imela nič ,drugega kakor nekaj jagod, ki sta jih nabrala. Bila sta tudi že tako utrujena, da ju noge niso hotele več nositi. Tako sta legla pod neko drevo in zaspala. To je bilo že tretje jutro, odkar sta odšla iz hiše svojega očeta. Vzela sta spet pot pod noge, a sta zašla še globlje v gozd. Čutila sta, da bosta omagala in umrla, če ne pride kmalu kakšna pomoč. Ko je bilo okrog poldne, sta zagledala lepo, snežno belo ptico, ki je sedela na veji in tako prelepo gostolela, da sta se ustavila in ji prisluhnila. Ko je utihnila, je razpela krila in poletavala pred njima. Otroka sta šla za ptico, dokler nista prišla do neke hišice, kjer je ptica sedla na streho. Ko pa sta prišla čisto blizu, sta opazila, da je hišica iz kruha sezidana in s štrukeljčki pokrita; okenca pa so bila iz svetlega sladkorčka. »Tega se pa kar lotiva,« je rekel Janko Metki. »Privoščiva si pošteno južino. Jaz bom pojedel košček strehe, ti, Metka, pa vzemi košček okna, da se boš posladkala.« Janko je segel z roko in odlomil košček strehe, da bi videl, kako tekne. Metka pa se je lotila šipe in začela hrustati. Tedaj se je oglasil tenek glas iz sobe: »Hrst, brst, kateri miško kruši, hrusta mojo hiško«
 Otroka pa sta odgovorila »Vetrc, vetrc iz neba okrog hišice pihlja,« in sta jedla dalje ter se nista dala motiti. Janko, ki mu je streha prav dobro teknila, jo je iztrgal velik kos in Metka je potegnila ven celo okroglo šipo, sedla na tla in si privoščila. Tedaj pa so se nenadoma odprla vrata in ven je prišantala kakor zemlja stara ženska, ki se je opirala na bergle. Janko in Metka sta se tako prestrašila, da jima je popadalo na tla vse, kar sta držala v rokah. Starka pa je zmajevala z glavo in govorila: »Ejej, ljuba otroka moja, kdo pa vaju je pripeljal sem? Stopita no v hišo in ostanita pri meni. Nič hudega se vama ne bo zgodilo.« a se vama ne bo zgodilo.« Prijela ju je za roko in ju odpeljala v hišico. Tam so jima pripravili dobro kosilo, mleko in cvrtnjak s sladkorjem, jabolka in orehe. Nato so belo postlali dve lepi posteljici in Janko in in orehe. Nato so belo postlali dve lepi posteljici in Janko in Metka sta legla in sladko zaspala. Starka pa se je samo delala dobro. Bila je hudobna čarovnica, ki je prežala na otroke in je svojo kruhasto hišico sezidala samo zato, da bi jih privabila. Ko je prišel kak otrok v njeno samo zato, da bi jih privabila. Ko je prišel kak otrok v njeno oblast, ga je ubila, skuhala in ga požrla. Čarovnice imajo rdeče oči in ne morejo videti daleč. Imajo pa tenek voh kakor živali in zaduhajo, če pridejo ljudje v bližino. Ko sta se Janko in Metka bližala njeni hišici, se je ženska zlobno zasmejala in posmehljivo dejala: »Ta dva sta mi padla v kremplje. Ne bosta mi popihala.« Zgodaj zjutraj, ko sta otroka še spala, je že vstala in ko ju je videla, kako milo spita s svojimi polnimi rdečimi lički, je zamrmrala predse: »To bo slasten prigrizek!«
 Zgrabila je Janka s svojimi koščenimi rokami ga odnesla v majhen hlev in ga zaprla za zamrežena vrata. Ni mu pomagalo, da je kričal in vpil na vse grlo. Nato je stopila k Metki in jo stresla, da se je zdramila. Zaklicala ji je: »Vstani, zaspanka, nanosi vode in skuhaj svojemu bratu kaj dobrega. Zaprt je v hlevu, da se bo zredil. Ko bo lepo rejen, ga bom pojedla.« Metka je bridko zajokala, a bilo je vse zaman, morala je storiti, kar je zahtevala hudobna čarovnica. Tako so ubogemu Janku kuhali najboljše jedi, Metka pa je dobivala samo ostanke. Vsako jutro je odšantala starka k hlevčku in zaklicala: »Janček, pomoli ven svoj prst, da bom potipala, ali boš kmalu rejen.« Janko pa ji je pomolil koščico in starka, ki je imela brljave oči, tega ni mogla videti in je mislila, da so Jankovi prsti, ter se čudila, da se kar nič ne zredi. Ko so minili štirje tedni in je Janko ostal še kar suh, jo je premagala nepotrpežljivost in ni marala več čakati. Metka,« je zaklicala deklici, »skoči hitro in nanosi vodo. Naj bo Janko debel ali suh, jutri ga bom zaklala in ga skuhala.« Oh, kako je jokala uboga deklica, ko je morala nositi vodo! Kako so ji tekle solze po licih! »Bolje bi bilo, da bi naju požrle divje zveri v gozdu. Tako bi vsaj skupaj umrla!« je tarnala. »Nikar se ne cmeri,« jo je osorno zavrnila starka, »to vse ti ne bo prav nič pomagalo.« Metka je morala zgodaj zjutraj obesiti kotel z vodo in zakuriti ogenj. »A najprej moramo speči kruh,« je rekla starka. »Krušno peč sem že zakurila in tudi testo zamesila!«
Pahnila je ubogo Metko pred peč, iz katere so že švigali plameni. »Zlezi vanjo,« je rekla čarovnica, »in poglej, ali je dovolj zakurjeno, da lahko damo kruh vanjo.« In če bi jo bila Metka poslušala, bi čarovnica zaprla v jo peč, da bi se Metka spekla v nji. In potem bi o bila pojedla. Metka pa je uganila, kaj stara namerava in je rekla: »Ne vem, kako naj to storim. Kako pa pridem vanjo?« »Gos neumna, saj je odprtina dovolj velika, vidiš, še jaz bi lahko zlezla vanjo,« je rekla stara, se primajala in vtaknila glavo v peč. Metka pa jo je krepko sunila, da je zdrsnila vanjo. Zaprla je železna vrata za njo. Oh, kako grozansko je zavreščala stara! A nič ni pomagalo. Čarovnica je morala zgoreti. Metka je jadrno stekla naravnost k Janku, odprla njegov hlevček in zaklicala: »Janko, rešena sva, stara čarovnica je mrtva!« Janko je skočil ven kakor ptička iz kletke, če ji odpreš vratca. Kako sta se veselila! Vrgla sta se drug drugemu okoli vratu, poskakovala in se poljubljala! In ker se jima ni bilo treba ničesar več bati, sta šla v čarovničino hišo. Tam pa so bili po vseh kotih zabojčki z biseri in dragulji. »Ti so pa veliko boljši kakor kamenčki,« je rekel Janko in si jih natlačil v žepe, kolikor je mogel. »Tudi jaz bi rada kaj prinesla domov,« je rekla Metka ter si z njimi napolnila svoj predpasniček. »Zdaj pa jo pobrišiva od tod,« je dejal Janko, »da prideva iz tega čarovniškega gozda.« a nekaj Ko sta hodila ur, sta prišla do velike vode. »Saj ne moreva čez videti.« ,« je dejal Janko, »ne brvi ne mostu ni videti.«
 »Tudi nobene barčice ni na vodi,« mu je odgovorila Metka »tamle pa plava bela račka. Če jo poprosim, nama bo gotovo Pomagala čez vodo.« Vzkliknila je: »Račka, ljuba račka ti, ker ni mostička ne brvi, midva prosiva lepo, da naju prepelješ čez vodo.« In račka je res priplavala in Janko ji je sedel na hrbet in rekel sestrici, naj sede zraven njega. »Ne,« je odgovorila Metka, »to bi bilo za račko pretežko, drugega za drugim naju bo.« In dobra račka je res storila tako in ko sta bila srečno na drugem bregu in ko sta še nekaj časa hodila, se jima je zazdel gozd čedalje bolj znan in domač. In nazadnje sta od daleč zagledala hišo svojega očeta. Začela sta teči, planila sta v sobo in se vrgla očetu okrog vratu. Odkar je revni drvar pustil svoja otroka v gozdu, ni imel niti trenutka miru in pokoja več. Njegova hudobna žena pa je bila medtem umrla. Metka je stresla iz svojega predpasnička bisere in dragulje, da so se kar trkljali po izbi. Janko pa ",2484
4,LITTLE RED-CAP [LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD],"Once upon a time there was a dear little girl who was loved by everyone
who looked at her, but most of all by her grandmother, and there was
nothing that she would not have given to the child. Once she gave her a
little cap of red velvet, which suited her so well that she would never
wear anything else; so she was always called ‘Little Red-Cap.’

One day her mother said to her: ‘Come, Little Red-Cap, here is a piece
of cake and a bottle of wine; take them to your grandmother, she is ill
and weak, and they will do her good. Set out before it gets hot, and
when you are going, walk nicely and quietly and do not run off the path,
or you may fall and break the bottle, and then your grandmother will
get nothing; and when you go into her room, don’t forget to say, “Good
morning”, and don’t peep into every corner before you do it.’

‘I will take great care,’ said Little Red-Cap to her mother, and gave
her hand on it.

The grandmother lived out in the wood, half a league from the village,
and just as Little Red-Cap entered the wood, a wolf met her. Red-Cap
did not know what a wicked creature he was, and was not at all afraid of
him.

‘Good day, Little Red-Cap,’ said he.

‘Thank you kindly, wolf.’

‘Whither away so early, Little Red-Cap?’

‘To my grandmother’s.’

‘What have you got in your apron?’

‘Cake and wine; yesterday was baking-day, so poor sick grandmother is to
have something good, to make her stronger.’

‘Where does your grandmother live, Little Red-Cap?’

‘A good quarter of a league farther on in the wood; her house stands
under the three large oak-trees, the nut-trees are just below; you
surely must know it,’ replied Little Red-Cap.

The wolf thought to himself: ‘What a tender young creature! what a nice
plump mouthful--she will be better to eat than the old woman. I must
act craftily, so as to catch both.’ So he walked for a short time by
the side of Little Red-Cap, and then he said: ‘See, Little Red-Cap, how
pretty the flowers are about here--why do you not look round? I believe,
too, that you do not hear how sweetly the little birds are singing; you
walk gravely along as if you were going to school, while everything else
out here in the wood is merry.’

Little Red-Cap raised her eyes, and when she saw the sunbeams dancing
here and there through the trees, and pretty flowers growing everywhere,
she thought: ‘Suppose I take grandmother a fresh nosegay; that would
please her too. It is so early in the day that I shall still get there
in good time’; and so she ran from the path into the wood to look for
flowers. And whenever she had picked one, she fancied that she saw a
still prettier one farther on, and ran after it, and so got deeper and
deeper into the wood.

Meanwhile the wolf ran straight to the grandmother’s house and knocked
at the door.

‘Who is there?’

‘Little Red-Cap,’ replied the wolf. ‘She is bringing cake and wine; open
the door.’

‘Lift the latch,’ called out the grandmother, ‘I am too weak, and cannot
get up.’

The wolf lifted the latch, the door sprang open, and without saying a
word he went straight to the grandmother’s bed, and devoured her. Then
he put on her clothes, dressed himself in her cap laid himself in bed
and drew the curtains.

Little Red-Cap, however, had been running about picking flowers,
and when she had gathered so many that she could carry no more, she
remembered her grandmother, and set out on the way to her.

She was surprised to find the cottage-door standing open, and when she
went into the room, she had such a strange feeling that she said to
herself: ‘Oh dear! how uneasy I feel today, and at other times I like
being with grandmother so much.’ She called out: ‘Good morning,’ but
received no answer; so she went to the bed and drew back the curtains.
There lay her grandmother with her cap pulled far over her face, and
looking very strange.

‘Oh! grandmother,’ she said, ‘what big ears you have!’

‘The better to hear you with, my child,’ was the reply.

‘But, grandmother, what big eyes you have!’ she said.

‘The better to see you with, my dear.’

‘But, grandmother, what large hands you have!’

‘The better to hug you with.’

‘Oh! but, grandmother, what a terrible big mouth you have!’

‘The better to eat you with!’

And scarcely had the wolf said this, than with one bound he was out of
bed and swallowed up Red-Cap.

When the wolf had appeased his appetite, he lay down again in the bed,
fell asleep and began to snore very loud. The huntsman was just passing
the house, and thought to himself: ‘How the old woman is snoring! I must
just see if she wants anything.’ So he went into the room, and when he
came to the bed, he saw that the wolf was lying in it. ‘Do I find you
here, you old sinner!’ said he. ‘I have long sought you!’ Then just as
he was going to fire at him, it occurred to him that the wolf might have
devoured the grandmother, and that she might still be saved, so he did
not fire, but took a pair of scissors, and began to cut open the stomach
of the sleeping wolf. When he had made two snips, he saw the little
Red-Cap shining, and then he made two snips more, and the little girl
sprang out, crying: ‘Ah, how frightened I have been! How dark it was
inside the wolf’; and after that the aged grandmother came out alive
also, but scarcely able to breathe. Red-Cap, however, quickly fetched
great stones with which they filled the wolf’s belly, and when he awoke,
he wanted to run away, but the stones were so heavy that he collapsed at
once, and fell dead.

Then all three were delighted. The huntsman drew off the wolf’s skin and
went home with it; the grandmother ate the cake and drank the wine which
Red-Cap had brought, and revived, but Red-Cap thought to herself: ‘As
long as I live, I will never by myself leave the path, to run into the
wood, when my mother has forbidden me to do so.’",1118,Rdeca_kapica,"Bila je nekoč majhna, srčkana deklica, ki jo je vsakdo vzljubil, če ga je le pogledala. Najrajši pa jo je imela njena babica. Ta sploh ni vedela, kaj vse bi ji dala. Nekoč ji je podarila kapico iz rdečega žameta. Ker ji je tako ljubko pristajala in ker tudi sama ni hotela nositi nič drugega več, so ji rekli kar Rdeča kapica. Nekega dne ji je rekla mama: »Rdeča kapica, na kos pogače in steklenico vina in nesi to naši babici. Babica je bolna in slaba in to ji bo dobro delo. Pokrepčalo jo bo. Le hitro se odpravi, da ne bo prevroče. In ko prideš v gozd, hodi lepo naravnost in ne tekaj po stranskih stezah, da ne boš padla in razbila steklenice, tako bi babica ničesar ne dobila. In ko vstopiš v sobo, ne pozabi voščiti dobro jutro in ne kukaj prej po vseh kotih in kotičkih.« »Vse bom napravila lepo v redu, kakor je treba,« je rekla Rdeča kapica in dala mami roko. Babica pa je imela hišico dve uri daleč od vasi, sredi nekega gozda. Ko je Rdeča kapica prišla v hosto, je srečala volka. Ker ni vedela, kakšna huda zver je to, se ga ni bala. »Dobro jutro, Rdeča kapica,« jo je nagovoril volk. »Dobro jutro, volk.« »Kam pa že tako zgodaj, Rdeča kapica?« »K babici sem namenjena.« »Kaj pa imaš v košarici?« 

»Kos pogače in steklenico vina. Včeraj smo pekli, pa naj se babica, ki je bolna in slaba, malo posladka in Pokrepča s tem.« »Rdeča kapica, kje pa stanuje tvoja babica?« »Kakšne četrt ure je še. čisto vgozdt' pod tremi visokimi hrasti je njena hišica. Okrog je leskovanileja z lešniki, saj jo gotovo poznaš,« mu je razložila Rdeča kapica. »Mhm, ta mlada, rahla stvarcam je pomislil volk sam pri sebi, »to bo masten prigrizek, ki bo še veliko bolje teknil kakor stara. Lepo zvito se je treba lotiti, pa bom obe pohrustal.« Stopal je nekaj časa vštric Rdeče kapice, nato pa je glasno dejal: »Poglej no, Rdeča kapica, tele lepe cvetke, ki rastejo vsepovsod ob poti. Zakaj si jih malo ne ogledaš? Mislim, da niti ne slišiš, kako milo prepevajo ptičke? Tako zamišljeno hodiš po stezi, kakor bi šla v šolo. Pa je vendar vse tako veselo in zanimivo tu v gozdu.« Rdeča kapica je pogledala okrog sebe. Ko je videla, kako poplesavajo sončni žarki skozi drevje in kako je vseokrog polno lepih cvetic, je pomislila: »Če natrgam šopek cvetlic za babico, jih bo gotovo zelo vesela. Zgodaj je pa še tudi in bom še pravi čas prišla k njej.« Stekla je s poti v gozd in začela trgati cvetlice. In ko je katero odtrgala, se ji je zazdelo, da je malo bolj stran še ena lepša. Stekla je k njej in je bila tako čedalje globlje v gozdu. Volk pa jo je medtem ubral naravnost proti babičini hišici. Ko je prišel tja, je potrkal na vrata. »Kdo pa je zunaj?« je vprašala babica s šibkim glasom. »Rdeča kapica. Prinesla sem ti pogače in vina, odpri mi.« »Kar na kljuko pritisni,« je odgovorila babica. »Preveč sem slaba in ne morem vstati.« Volk je pritisnil na kljuko, vrata so se odprla. On pa je šel, ne da bi bil kaj zinil, naravnost k postelji in požrl babico. 

Nato si je oblekel njeno obleko, posadil na glavo njeno čepico, legel v njeno posteljo ter zagrnil zaveso. Rdeča kapica pa je tekala za cvetlicami. Ko jih je toliko nabrala, da jih ni mogla več nositi, se je spet spomnila babice in odpravila se je k njej. Začudila se je, da so bila vrata odprta. In ko je vstopila, jo je tako čudno spreletelo, da je pomislila: »Jej, kako tesno mi je danes pri srcu. Pa sem bila drugače zmerom tako rada pri babici.« Zavzdihnila je in rekla glasno: »Dobro jutro.« Odgovora pa ni bilo. Zato je stopila k postelji in odgrnila zavese. Pred njo je ležala babica, s čepico, ki jo je imela potisnjeno globoko na obraz. In tako čudna je bila videti. »Joj, babica, kako velika ušesa imaš!« »Da te lahko bolje slišim.« »Joj, babica, kako velike oči imaš!« »Da te lahko bolje vidim.« »Joj, babica, kako velike roke imaš!« »Da te lahko bolje zgrabim.« »Jojmene, babica, kako grozno velika usta imaš!« »Da te lahko bolje požrem!« Volk je zarenčal, bil v skoku iz postelje in požrl ubogo Rdečo kapico. Ko je volk tako nasitil svoj pohlep, je legel spet nazaj v posteljo, zaspal in pričel smrčati, da je kar odmevalo po hiši. Pa je prišel mimo hiše lovec, slišal to in začudeno pomislil: »Kako smrči stara žena. Moram pogledati, če se ji ni kaj zgodilo.« Stopil je v sobo, in ko je prišel do postelje, je videl, da leži volk v njej. »Ha, tukaj sem te našel, mrcina stara!« je vzkliknil. »Že dolgo sem te iskal.« 

Že je hotel nameriti, da bi ustrelil, kar se je domislil, da je volk nemara požrl babico in da bi jo mogoče še lahko rešil. Zato je vzel škarje in začel spečemu volku parati trebuh. Ko je prerezal kožo, je zagledal Rdečo kapico, ko pa je še malo globlje razparal, je skočila deklica iz trebuha. »Hu, kako me je bilo strah!« je vzkliknila. »Tako temno je bilo v volkovem trebuhu!« Nato je prišla ven tudi stara babica, še živa, in je komaj še dihala. Rdeča kapica pa je hitro prinesla nekaj debelih kamnov, ki so jih stlačili volku v trebuh. Ko se je volk malo prebudil, je hotel pobegniti. Kamni pa so bili tako težki, da je kar omahnil in padel mrtev na tla. Vsi trije so bili Zidane volje. Lovec je odrl volku kožo in odšel z njo domov. Babica je pojedla pogačo in popila vino, ki ga je Rdeča kapica prinesla, ter si spet opomogla. Rdeča kapica pa je resno premišljevala: »Nikdar več ne smeš uhajati s poti in sama tekati po gozdu, če ti je mama prepovedala. Kako hudo bi bilo ubogi mami, če bi jaz ostala v volkovem trebuhu!«

5,RUMPELSTILTSKIN,"By the side of a wood, in a country a long way off, ran a fine stream
of water; and upon the stream there stood a mill. The miller’s house was
close by, and the miller, you must know, had a very beautiful daughter.
She was, moreover, very shrewd and clever; and the miller was so proud
of her, that he one day told the king of the land, who used to come and
hunt in the wood, that his daughter could spin gold out of straw. Now
this king was very fond of money; and when he heard the miller’s boast
his greediness was raised, and he sent for the girl to be brought before
him. Then he led her to a chamber in his palace where there was a great
heap of straw, and gave her a spinning-wheel, and said, ‘All this must
be spun into gold before morning, as you love your life.’ It was in vain
that the poor maiden said that it was only a silly boast of her father,
for that she could do no such thing as spin straw into gold: the chamber
door was locked, and she was left alone.

She sat down in one corner of the room, and began to bewail her hard
fate; when on a sudden the door opened, and a droll-looking little man
hobbled in, and said, ‘Good morrow to you, my good lass; what are you
weeping for?’ ‘Alas!’ said she, ‘I must spin this straw into gold, and
I know not how.’ ‘What will you give me,’ said the hobgoblin, ‘to do it
for you?’ ‘My necklace,’ replied the maiden. He took her at her word,
and sat himself down to the wheel, and whistled and sang:

 ‘Round about, round about,
    Lo and behold!
  Reel away, reel away,
    Straw into gold!’

And round about the wheel went merrily; the work was quickly done, and
the straw was all spun into gold.

When the king came and saw this, he was greatly astonished and pleased;
but his heart grew still more greedy of gain, and he shut up the poor
miller’s daughter again with a fresh task. Then she knew not what to do,
and sat down once more to weep; but the dwarf soon opened the door, and
said, ‘What will you give me to do your task?’ ‘The ring on my finger,’
said she. So her little friend took the ring, and began to work at the
wheel again, and whistled and sang:

 ‘Round about, round about,
    Lo and behold!
  Reel away, reel away,
    Straw into gold!’

till, long before morning, all was done again.

The king was greatly delighted to see all this glittering treasure;
but still he had not enough: so he took the miller’s daughter to a yet
larger heap, and said, ‘All this must be spun tonight; and if it is,
you shall be my queen.’ As soon as she was alone that dwarf came in, and
said, ‘What will you give me to spin gold for you this third time?’
‘I have nothing left,’ said she. ‘Then say you will give me,’ said
the little man, ‘the first little child that you may have when you are
queen.’ ‘That may never be,’ thought the miller’s daughter: and as she
knew no other way to get her task done, she said she would do what he
asked. Round went the wheel again to the old song, and the manikin once
more spun the heap into gold. The king came in the morning, and, finding
all he wanted, was forced to keep his word; so he married the miller’s
daughter, and she really became queen.

At the birth of her first little child she was very glad, and forgot the
dwarf, and what she had said. But one day he came into her room, where
she was sitting playing with her baby, and put her in mind of it. Then
she grieved sorely at her misfortune, and said she would give him all
the wealth of the kingdom if he would let her off, but in vain; till at
last her tears softened him, and he said, ‘I will give you three days’
grace, and if during that time you tell me my name, you shall keep your
child.’

Now the queen lay awake all night, thinking of all the odd names that
she had ever heard; and she sent messengers all over the land to find
out new ones. The next day the little man came, and she began with
TIMOTHY, ICHABOD, BENJAMIN, JEREMIAH, and all the names she could
remember; but to all and each of them he said, ‘Madam, that is not my
name.’

The second day she began with all the comical names she could hear of,
BANDY-LEGS, HUNCHBACK, CROOK-SHANKS, and so on; but the little gentleman
still said to every one of them, ‘Madam, that is not my name.’

The third day one of the messengers came back, and said, ‘I have
travelled two days without hearing of any other names; but yesterday, as
I was climbing a high hill, among the trees of the forest where the fox
and the hare bid each other good night, I saw a little hut; and before
the hut burnt a fire; and round about the fire a funny little dwarf was
dancing upon one leg, and singing:

 “Merrily the feast I’ll make.
  Today I’ll brew, tomorrow bake;
  Merrily I’ll dance and sing,
  For next day will a stranger bring.
  Little does my lady dream
  Rumpelstiltskin is my name!”

When the queen heard this she jumped for joy, and as soon as her little
friend came she sat down upon her throne, and called all her court round
to enjoy the fun; and the nurse stood by her side with the baby in her
arms, as if it was quite ready to be given up. Then the little man began
to chuckle at the thought of having the poor child, to take home with
him to his hut in the woods; and he cried out, ‘Now, lady, what is my
name?’ ‘Is it JOHN?’ asked she. ‘No, madam!’ ‘Is it TOM?’ ‘No, madam!’
‘Is it JEMMY?’ ‘It is not.’ ‘Can your name be ?’ said the
lady slyly. ‘Some witch told you that!--some witch told you that!’ cried
the little man, and dashed his right foot in a rage so deep into the
floor, that he was forced to lay hold of it with both hands to pull it
out.

Then he made the best of his way off, while the nurse laughed and the
baby crowed; and all the court jeered at him for having had so much
trouble for nothing, and said, ‘We wish you a very good morning, and a
merry feast, Mr RUMPLESTILTSKIN!’",1151,Spicparkeljc,"Bil je nekoč mlinar, ki je bil reven, a je imel zalo hčer. Zgodilo se je, da se je nekega dne zapletel s kraljem v pogovor in da bi se pokazal imenitnega, mu je rekel: »Hčer imam, ki zna iz slame presti zlato.« »Oho!« se je začudil kralj. »To je pa umetnost, ki mi je všeč! Če je tvoja hči res tako spretna, kakor praviš, jo pripelji jutri na moj grad. Preskusil jo bom.« Kmet je privedel dekle na grad. Tam so jo odpeljali v izbo, ki je bila polna slame. Kralj ji je dal kolo in vreteno in ji rekel: »Sedi zdaj lepo k delu in če do jutri zjutraj ne spredeš iz te slame zlata, moraš umreti.« Nato je zaklenil izbo, dekle pa je ostalo samo v njej. Tako je sedela tam uboga mlinarjeva hči in si ni znala pomagati. Saj niti pojma ni imela, kako naj bi spredla iz slame zlato. Vedno bolj strah jo je postajalo, tako da je začela nazadnje bridko jokati. Tedaj so se naenkrat odprla vrata in v izbo je stopil čuden majhen možic ter dejal: »Dober večer, mlinarica mlada, kaj pa tako bridko jokaš?« »Oh, oh!« je zajokalo dekle. »Iz slame bi morala spresti zlato, pa ne znam tega.« »Kaj mi daš, če ti ga jaz spredem?« je vprašal možic. »Tole svojo ogrlico,« je reklo dekle. Možiček je vzel ogrlico, sedel h kolesu in drrr drrr drrr, trikrat potegnil, pa je bil vitel poln. Nato je nataknil drugega, in drrr drrr drrr, trikrat potegnil, pa je bil tudi drugi vitel poln. 

Tako je šlo tja do jutra, in že je bila spredena vsa slama in vsi vitli so bili polni zlata. Ob sončnem vzhodu je že prišel kralj. Ko je zagledal zlato, se je močno začudil, srce pa mu je bilo le še pohlepnejše po zlatu. Dal je odpeljati mlinarjevo hčer v drugo izbo s slamo, ki je bila še veliko večja. Ukazal ji je, naj slamo tudi v tej noči sprede v zlato, če ji je življenje drago. Dekle si ni vedelo pomagati in je bridko jokalo. Tedaj so se spet odprla vrata. Prišel je mali možic in dejal: »Kaj mi daš, če ti spredem slamo v zlato?« »Tale svoj prstanček s prsta,« je odgovorilo dekle. Možic je vzel prstan, pognal je kolovrat in je do jutra spredel vso slamo v bleščeče zlato. Kralj se je ob pogledu nanj nadvse razveselil. Njegovo srce pa še ni bilo sito zlata. Velel je odvesti mlinarjevo hčer v še večjo izbo, polno slame. »Še tole moraš spresti nocojšnjo noč,« ji je rekel. »Če se ti posreči, postaneš moja soproga.« Kaj zato, je pomislil, če je mlinarjeva hči, bogatejše žene zlepa ne dobim na vsem svetu. Ko je bilo dekle samo, je še tretjič prišel možic in jo vprašal: »Kaj mi daš, če ti še tokrat spredem siamo?« »Ničesar več nimam, kar bi ti lahko dala,« je odgovorilo dekle. »Pa mi obljubi svojega prvega otroka, ko boš kraljica.« Kdo ve, kaj bo še iz tega, je pomislila mlinarjeva hči, in si tudi iz te stiske ni znala drugače pomagati, kot da je obljubila možicu, kar je zahteval. In zato ji je še enkrat spredel vso slamo v zlato. Zjutraj je prišel kralj in je našel vse tako, kakor je želel. Bil je mož-beseda in se je res oženil z dekletom. In zala mlinarjeva hči je postala kraljica. 

Čez leto dni je povila lepega otročička in ni več mislila na tistega tujega možička. Ta pa je vstopil in dejal: »Zdaj mi daj, kar si mi obljubila.« Kraljica se je prestrašila in je ponudila možicu bogastvo vse dežele, če ji hoče pustiti otroka. Možic pa je dejal: »Ne, živa stvar mi je ljubša kakor vsi zakladi sveta.« Tedaj je začela kraljica tako presunljivo tarnati in jokati, da se je možicu zasmilila: »Tri dni ti dam časa,« ji je rekel, »če zveš moje ime, lahko obdržiš otroka.« Kraljica je vso noč premišljevala o vseh mogočih imenih, ki jih je kdaj slišala. Po vsej deželi je razposlala sle, da bi poizvedeli daleč naokrog, kakšna imena še obstajajo. Ko je možic drugo jutro prišel, je začela z Gašperjem, Mihom in Boltežarjem ter mu imenovala vsa imena po vrsti. Možic pa je ob vsakem dejal: »Ne, tako mi ni ime.« Drugi dan je poslala sle še dlje v deželo, da bi poizvedeli kako se ljudje imenujejo. In možicu je naštevala najbolj nenavadna in najbolj čudna imena: »Ali se pišeš nemara Rebrce ali Koštrunovo bedrce ali Zadrga?« Možic pa je odgovarjal samo: »Ne, tako mi ni ime.« Tretji dan pa je eden od slov pripovedoval takole: »Za nobeno novo ime nisem več zvedel. Pač pa sem prišel na visokem hribu v neko gozdno zakotje, tja, kjer si lisica in zajec voščita lahko noč. Zagledal sem majhno hišico. Pred hišico je gorel ogenj in okrog ognja je plesal prečuden smešen možic, poskakoval na eni nogi in pel: Danes pečem, jutri smodim, pojutrišnjem pa kraljička dobim; 

to je dobro, to je dobro, da nihče ne ve, da mi je Špicparkeljc ime.« Lahko si mislite, kako je bila kraljica vesela, ko je to slišala. Drugo jutro je prišel možic in vprašal: »No, gospa kraljica, kako mi je ime?« Kraljica pa ga je za šalo najprej vprašala: »Ali si morebiti Urh?« »Nisem.« »Ali pa morda Jur?« »Nak.« »Kaj pa če si nemara Špicparkeljc?« je nazadnje vprašala s posebnim poudarkom. Možic je kar pozelenel od jeze: »To ti je povedal sam hudič, to ti je povedal sam hudič!« In od jeze je udaril z levo nogo tako globoko v zemljo, da se je do pol života pogreznil vanjo. Nato pa je v svoji togoti zgrabil z obema rokama svojo levo nogo in sam sebe na dvoje preklal. ",951
6,THE OLD MAN AND HIS GRANDSON,"There was once a very old man, whose eyes had become dim, his ears dull
of hearing, his knees trembled, and when he sat at table he could hardly
hold the spoon, and spilt the broth upon the table-cloth or let it run
out of his mouth. His son and his son’s wife were disgusted at this, so
the old grandfather at last had to sit in the corner behind the stove,
and they gave him his food in an earthenware bowl, and not even enough
of it. And he used to look towards the table with his eyes full of
tears. Once, too, his trembling hands could not hold the bowl, and it
fell to the ground and broke. The young wife scolded him, but he said
nothing and only sighed. Then they brought him a wooden bowl for a few
half-pence, out of which he had to eat.

They were once sitting thus when the little grandson of four years old
began to gather together some bits of wood upon the ground. ‘What are
you doing there?’ asked the father. ‘I am making a little trough,’
answered the child, ‘for father and mother to eat out of when I am big.’

The man and his wife looked at each other for a while, and presently
began to cry. Then they took the old grandfather to the table, and
henceforth always let him eat with them, and likewise said nothing if he
did spill a little of anything.",252,Ded_in_vnuk,"Bil je mož, ki je bil star kakor zemlja; oči so mu opešale in se solzile, ušesa so mu oglušela in kolena so se mu tresla. Ko je sedel pri jedi za mizo in komaj držal žlico v roki, se je juha zlivala na prt na mizi in tudi iz ust se mu je kaj pocedilo. Sinu in njegovi ženi se je to gnusilo. Zato sta nazadnje posadila deda v kot za peč, kjer sta mu dajala jesti iz lončene skledice, pa še to ne toliko, da bi se do sitega najedel. Tako je starček ves potrt gledal k mizi in solze so mu tekle iz oči. Nekoč njegove tresoče se roke niso mogle obdržati sklede; padla mu je na tla in se razbila. Mlada žena ga je ozmerjala, on pa ni ničesar rekel in je samo zavzdihnil. Nato mu je za majhen denar kupila leseno skledico in iz nje je moral jesti. Ko so pa nekoč tako sedeli, je mali štiriletni vnuk začel sestavljati na tleh neke deščice. »Kaj boš pa naredil?« ga je vprašal oče. »Majhno koritce,« je odgovoril otrok. »Iz njega bosta jedla mama in ata, ko bom jaz velik.« Tedaj sta se mož in žena za nekaj trenutkov spogledala, nato pa so jima privrele solze iz oči. Nemudoma sta prosila deda, naj sede k njima za mizo. In odslej je moral vedno jesti z njima in tudi nista nič rekla, če se mu je kaj razlilo.

7,CLEVER ELSIE,"There was once a man who had a daughter who was called Clever Elsie. And
when she had grown up her father said: ‘We will get her married.’ ‘Yes,’
said the mother, ‘if only someone would come who would have her.’ At
length a man came from a distance and wooed her, who was called Hans;
but he stipulated that Clever Elsie should be really smart. ‘Oh,’ said
the father, ‘she has plenty of good sense’; and the mother said: ‘Oh,
she can see the wind coming up the street, and hear the flies coughing.’
‘Well,’ said Hans, ‘if she is not really smart, I won’t have her.’ When
they were sitting at dinner and had eaten, the mother said: ‘Elsie, go
into the cellar and fetch some beer.’ Then Clever Elsie took the pitcher
from the wall, went into the cellar, and tapped the lid briskly as she
went, so that the time might not appear long. When she was below she
fetched herself a chair, and set it before the barrel so that she had
no need to stoop, and did not hurt her back or do herself any unexpected
injury. Then she placed the can before her, and turned the tap, and
while the beer was running she would not let her eyes be idle, but
looked up at the wall, and after much peering here and there, saw a
pick-axe exactly above her, which the masons had accidentally left
there.

Then Clever Elsie began to weep and said: ‘If I get Hans, and we have
a child, and he grows big, and we send him into the cellar here to draw
beer, then the pick-axe will fall on his head and kill him.’ Then she
sat and wept and screamed with all the strength of her body, over the
misfortune which lay before her. Those upstairs waited for the drink,
but Clever Elsie still did not come. Then the woman said to the servant:
‘Just go down into the cellar and see where Elsie is.’ The maid went and
found her sitting in front of the barrel, screaming loudly. ‘Elsie why
do you weep?’ asked the maid. ‘Ah,’ she answered, ‘have I not reason to
weep? If I get Hans, and we have a child, and he grows big, and has to
draw beer here, the pick-axe will perhaps fall on his head, and kill
him.’ Then said the maid: ‘What a clever Elsie we have!’ and sat down
beside her and began loudly to weep over the misfortune. After a while,
as the maid did not come back, and those upstairs were thirsty for the
beer, the man said to the boy: ‘Just go down into the cellar and see
where Elsie and the girl are.’ The boy went down, and there sat Clever
Elsie and the girl both weeping together. Then he asked: ‘Why are you
weeping?’ ‘Ah,’ said Elsie, ‘have I not reason to weep? If I get Hans,
and we have a child, and he grows big, and has to draw beer here, the
pick-axe will fall on his head and kill him.’ Then said the boy: ‘What
a clever Elsie we have!’ and sat down by her, and likewise began to
howl loudly. Upstairs they waited for the boy, but as he still did not
return, the man said to the woman: ‘Just go down into the cellar and see
where Elsie is!’ The woman went down, and found all three in the midst
of their lamentations, and inquired what was the cause; then Elsie told
her also that her future child was to be killed by the pick-axe, when it
grew big and had to draw beer, and the pick-axe fell down. Then said the
mother likewise: ‘What a clever Elsie we have!’ and sat down and wept
with them. The man upstairs waited a short time, but as his wife did not
come back and his thirst grew ever greater, he said: ‘I must go into the
cellar myself and see where Elsie is.’ But when he got into the cellar,
and they were all sitting together crying, and he heard the reason, and
that Elsie’s child was the cause, and the Elsie might perhaps bring one
into the world some day, and that he might be killed by the pick-axe, if
he should happen to be sitting beneath it, drawing beer just at the very
time when it fell down, he cried: ‘Oh, what a clever Elsie!’ and sat
down, and likewise wept with them. The bridegroom stayed upstairs alone
for a long time; then as no one would come back he thought: ‘They must be
waiting for me below: I too must go there and see what they are about.’
When he got down, the five of them were sitting screaming and lamenting
quite piteously, each out-doing the other. ‘What misfortune has happened
then?’ asked he. ‘Ah, dear Hans,’ said Elsie, ‘if we marry each other
and have a child, and he is big, and we perhaps send him here to draw
something to drink, then the pick-axe which has been left up there might
dash his brains out if it were to fall down, so have we not reason to
weep?’ ‘Come,’ said Hans, ‘more understanding than that is not needed
for my household, as you are such a clever Elsie, I will have you,’ and
seized her hand, took her upstairs with him, and married her.

After Hans had had her some time, he said: ‘Wife, I am going out to work
and earn some money for us; go into the field and cut the corn that we
may have some bread.’ ‘Yes, dear Hans, I will do that.’ After Hans had
gone away, she cooked herself some good broth and took it into the field
with her. When she came to the field she said to herself: ‘What shall I
do; shall I cut first, or shall I eat first? Oh, I will eat first.’ Then
she drank her cup of broth and when she was fully satisfied, she once
more said: ‘What shall I do? Shall I cut first, or shall I sleep first?
I will sleep first.’ Then she lay down among the corn and fell asleep.
Hans had been at home for a long time, but Elsie did not come; then said
he: ‘What a clever Elsie I have; she is so industrious that she does not
even come home to eat.’ But when evening came and she still stayed away,
Hans went out to see what she had cut, but nothing was cut, and she
was lying among the corn asleep. Then Hans hastened home and brought
a fowler’s net with little bells and hung it round about her, and she
still went on sleeping. Then he ran home, shut the house-door, and sat
down in his chair and worked. At length, when it was quite dark, Clever
Elsie awoke and when she got up there was a jingling all round about
her, and the bells rang at each step which she took. Then she was
alarmed, and became uncertain whether she really was Clever Elsie or
not, and said: ‘Is it I, or is it not I?’ But she knew not what answer
to make to this, and stood for a time in doubt; at length she thought:
‘I will go home and ask if it be I, or if it be not I, they will be sure
to know.’ She ran to the door of her own house, but it was shut; then
she knocked at the window and cried: ‘Hans, is Elsie within?’ ‘Yes,’
answered Hans, ‘she is within.’ Hereupon she was terrified, and said:
‘Ah, heavens! Then it is not I,’ and went to another door; but when the
people heard the jingling of the bells they would not open it, and she
could get in nowhere. Then she ran out of the village, and no one has
seen her since.",1348,Brihtna_Urska,"Bil je človek, ki je imel hčer, ki so ji rekli Brihtna Urška. Ko je odrasla, je rekel oče: »Omožimo jo.« »Saj,« je rekla mati, »ko bi le prišel kdo, ki bi jo hotel vzeti.« Nazadnje je od daleč prišel nekdo, Janez po imenu, in jo zasnubil, a s pogojem, da je Brihtna Urška tudi resnično pametna. »O,« je rekel oče, »ta ima soli v glavi.« Mati pa je dostavila: »Ah, ta vidi, kako veter teče po cesti, sliši, kako muhe kašljajo.« »No,« je rekel Janez, »če ni zares pametna, je rajši ne vzamem.« Ko so potem sedli za mizo in jedli, je rekla mati: »Stopi, Urška, v klet in prinesi piva.« Brihtna Urška je vzela vrč s stene, šla v klet in med potjo neutrudno klepala s pokrovom, da bi ji hitreje minil čas. Ko je bila spodaj, je prinesla pručko in jo postavila pred sod, da se ji ne bi bilo treba upogibati, pri čemer bi jo lahko začel boleti križ in bi se ji celo poškodoval. Nato je postavila vrč predse in odprla pivo. Medtem ko je pivo teklo, je ogledovala stene od tal do vrha, da ni pustila svojih oči brez dela. Po dolgem ogledovanju sem in tja je zagledala ravno nad seboj kljuko v stropu, ki so jo nepazljivi zidarji pozabili tam. Pametna Urška je začela jokati, govoreč: »Če vzamem Janeza in dobiva otroka in bo ta velik in pošljeva otroka v klet točit pivo, mu lahko pade kljuka na glavo in ga ubije.« 

Tako je sedela in jokala in na vse pretege vreščala zaradi nesreče, ki bi se mogla zgoditi. Tisti zgoraj so čakali pijače, Brihtne Urške pa le ni bilo od nikoder. Zato je gospodinja ukazala dekli: »Pojdi no v klet in poglej, kje tiči Urška.« Dekla je šla in jo našla, kako sedi pred sodom in se na ves glas dere. »Zakaj pa jokaš, Urška?« jo vpraša dekla. »Jojmene,« je odgovorila, »kako bi ne jokala? Če vzamem Janeza in dobiva otroka in bo ta velik in bo moral točiti pivo, mu nemara pade kljuka na glavo in ga ubije.« Nato reče dekla: »Kako je pametna naša Urška!« sede zraven nje in začne tudi sama jokati zaradi nesreče. Čez nekaj časa, ko dekle ni bilo nazaj in so bili zgoraj žejni in željni pijače, je gospodar rekel hlapcu: »Stopi no še ti v klet in poglej, kje sta ostali Urška in dekla.« Hlapec je šel in tam sta sedeli Brihtna Urška in dekla ter skupaj jokali. »Zakaj pa jokata?« je vprašal. »Jojmene,« je rekla Urška, »kaj bi ne jokala? Če vzamem Janeza in dobiva otroka in bo ta velik in bo tu natakal pijačo, mu pade kljuka na glavo in ga ubije.« Nato reče hlapec: »Kako je brihtna naša Urška!« in sede zraven nje ter začne tudi sam na ves glas jokati. Zgoraj so čakali hlapca, ko pa ga ni bilo od nikoder, je rekel gospodar ženi: »Stopi no v klet in poglej, kje je ostala Urška.« Gospodinja je odšla in našla vse tri, kako tarnajo, in je vprašala zakaj. In Urška je povedala, kako bo njenega otroka, ko bo velik in bo prišel pivo točit, ubila kljuka, ko bo padla s stene. 

Nato reče tudi mati: »Kako je brihtna naša Urška!« in sede in začne z drugimi vred jokati. Gospodar je čakal, ko pa še žene ni bilo od nikoder in je bila njegova žeja čedalje hujša, je dejal: »Zdaj moram pa sam v klet pogledat, kje je ostala Urška.« Ko pa pride v klet in so vsi štirje sedeli in jokali in ko je zvedel, da je tega kriv Urškin otrok, ki ga bo morebiti kdaj rodila in ga bo morda kljuka ubila, če bo ravno tisti čas padla s stene, ko bo točil pivo, je vzkliknil: »Kako brihtna Urška!« sedel k njim in začel tudi sam jokati. Ženin je dolgo časa ostal sam; ko pa ni hotelo biti nikogar od nikoder, je pomislil: »Gotovo me spodaj čakajo, pa pojdem še jaz dol, da vidim, kaj nameravajo.« Ko pride dol, vidi, da sedi vsa peterica in se dere in stoka tako pretresljivo, eden huje kakor drugi. »Kakšna nesreča pa se vam je zgodila?« jih pobara ženin. »Oh, dragi Janez,« odgovori Urška, »če se midva vzameva in dobiva otroka in bo velik in ga morebiti pošljeva sem dol točit pijačo, mu lahko tale kljuka, ki je obtičala tamle gori, razbije glavo, če bo padla na tla, da bo pri priči mrtev. Kako ne bi jokali?« »No,« ji je rekel Janez, »več pameti za moje gospodinjstvo ni treba; ker si tako brihtna, Urška, te vzamem za ženo.« Prijel jo je za roko in jo vzel s seboj ter napravil svatbo, ko se je oženil z njo. Ko sta bila že nekaj časa mož in žena, je rekel Janez: »Žena, z doma moram na delo, da kaj zaslužim, ti pa pojdi na polje in požanji žito, da bomo imeli kruha.« »Saj, ljubi Janez, storila bom to.« Ko je Janez odšel, si je Urška skuhala lonec tečnega močnika in ga vzela s seboj na polje. Ko pa pride na njivo, reče sama pri 

sebi »Kaj naj storim? Ali naj prej žanjem ali fužinam? Hej, najprej bom južinala.« Pojedla je svoj lonec močnika. Bila je pošteno sita; in se je vprašala: »Kaj naj storim? Ali naj prej požanjem ali se prej naspim? Hej, najprej bom spala.« Janez je bil že dolgo doma, Urška pa kar ni hotela priti in je pomislil: »Kako brihtno Urško sem dobil, tako je pridna, da še domov ne pride, da bi večerjala.« Ko pa je le ni bilo od nikoder in se je že zvečerilo, je odšel na polje gledat, koliko je požela; videl je, da ni nič požetega in da leži v žitu in spi. Janez se je podvizal domov, vzel ptičjo mrežo z majhnimi kraguljčki, šel spet na njivo in vanjo zavil ženo, ki je še zmerom spala. Nato je pohitel domov, zaklenil hišna vrata in sedel na svoj stol ter začel delati. Naposled, ko se je že čisto stemnilo, se je Brihtna Urška zbudila. Ko je vstala, je vse rožljalo okrog nje in zvončki so ji zvončkljali pri vsakem koraku, ki ga je napravila. Prestrašila se je in se zmedla, da ni vedela, ali je resnično prava Brihtna Urška ali ne, in se vprašala: »Ali sem ali nisem?« Ne vedoč, kaj naj si odgovori na to, je za nekaj časa neodločno obstala. Nazadnje je pomislila, da bi šla domov in vprašala: »Ali sem ali nisem.« Doma bojo že vedeli. Stekla je proti hišnim durim. Ta pa so bila zaklenjena. Potrkala je na okno in zaklicala: »Janez, je Urška doma?« »Je,« je odgovoril Janez, »v hiši je.« »Moj bog, potlej to nisem jaz,« je rekla vsa prestrašena ter odšla pred druga vrata. Ko pa so ljudje slišali zvončkljanje norčevskih kraguljčkov, ji niso hoteli odpreti in Brihtna Urška ni mogla nikjer najti strehe. Nazadnje je pobegnila iz vasi in je ni videl nihče več.

8,THE WOLF AND THE SEVEN LITTLE KIDS,"There was once upon a time an old goat who had seven little kids, and
loved them with all the love of a mother for her children. One day she
wanted to go into the forest and fetch some food. So she called all
seven to her and said: ‘Dear children, I have to go into the forest,
be on your guard against the wolf; if he comes in, he will devour you
all--skin, hair, and everything. The wretch often disguises himself, but
you will know him at once by his rough voice and his black feet.’ The
kids said: ‘Dear mother, we will take good care of ourselves; you may go
away without any anxiety.’ Then the old one bleated, and went on her way
with an easy mind.

It was not long before someone knocked at the house-door and called:
‘Open the door, dear children; your mother is here, and has brought
something back with her for each of you.’ But the little kids knew that
it was the wolf, by the rough voice. ‘We will not open the door,’ cried
they, ‘you are not our mother. She has a soft, pleasant voice, but
your voice is rough; you are the wolf!’ Then the wolf went away to a
shopkeeper and bought himself a great lump of chalk, ate this and made
his voice soft with it. Then he came back, knocked at the door of the
house, and called: ‘Open the door, dear children, your mother is here
and has brought something back with her for each of you.’ But the wolf
had laid his black paws against the window, and the children saw them
and cried: ‘We will not open the door, our mother has not black feet
like you: you are the wolf!’ Then the wolf ran to a baker and said: ‘I
have hurt my feet, rub some dough over them for me.’ And when the baker
had rubbed his feet over, he ran to the miller and said: ‘Strew some
white meal over my feet for me.’ The miller thought to himself: ‘The
wolf wants to deceive someone,’ and refused; but the wolf said: ‘If you
will not do it, I will devour you.’ Then the miller was afraid, and made
his paws white for him. Truly, this is the way of mankind.

So now the wretch went for the third time to the house-door, knocked at
it and said: ‘Open the door for me, children, your dear little mother
has come home, and has brought every one of you something back from the
forest with her.’ The little kids cried: ‘First show us your paws that
we may know if you are our dear little mother.’ Then he put his paws
in through the window and when the kids saw that they were white, they
believed that all he said was true, and opened the door. But who should
come in but the wolf! They were terrified and wanted to hide themselves.
One sprang under the table, the second into the bed, the third into the
stove, the fourth into the kitchen, the fifth into the cupboard, the
sixth under the washing-bowl, and the seventh into the clock-case. But
the wolf found them all, and used no great ceremony; one after the
other he swallowed them down his throat. The youngest, who was in
the clock-case, was the only one he did not find. When the wolf had
satisfied his appetite he took himself off, laid himself down under a
tree in the green meadow outside, and began to sleep. Soon afterwards
the old goat came home again from the forest. Ah! what a sight she saw
there! The house-door stood wide open. The table, chairs, and benches
were thrown down, the washing-bowl lay broken to pieces, and the quilts
and pillows were pulled off the bed. She sought her children, but they
were nowhere to be found. She called them one after another by name, but
no one answered. At last, when she came to the youngest, a soft voice
cried: ‘Dear mother, I am in the clock-case.’ She took the kid out, and
it told her that the wolf had come and had eaten all the others. Then
you may imagine how she wept over her poor children.

At length in her grief she went out, and the youngest kid ran with her.
When they came to the meadow, there lay the wolf by the tree and snored
so loud that the branches shook. She looked at him on every side and
saw that something was moving and struggling in his gorged belly. ‘Ah,
heavens,’ she said, ‘is it possible that my poor children whom he has
swallowed down for his supper, can be still alive?’ Then the kid had to
run home and fetch scissors, and a needle and thread, and the goat cut
open the monster’s stomach, and hardly had she made one cut, than one
little kid thrust its head out, and when she had cut farther, all six
sprang out one after another, and were all still alive, and had suffered
no injury whatever, for in his greediness the monster had swallowed them
down whole. What rejoicing there was! They embraced their dear mother,
and jumped like a tailor at his wedding. The mother, however, said: ‘Now
go and look for some big stones, and we will fill the wicked beast’s
stomach with them while he is still asleep.’ Then the seven kids dragged
the stones thither with all speed, and put as many of them into this
stomach as they could get in; and the mother sewed him up again in the
greatest haste, so that he was not aware of anything and never once
stirred.

When the wolf at length had had his fill of sleep, he got on his legs,
and as the stones in his stomach made him very thirsty, he wanted to
go to a well to drink. But when he began to walk and to move about, the
stones in his stomach knocked against each other and rattled. Then cried
he:

 ‘What rumbles and tumbles
  Against my poor bones?
  I thought ‘twas six kids,
  But it feels like big stones.’

And when he got to the well and stooped over the water to drink, the
heavy stones made him fall in, and he drowned miserably. When the seven
kids saw that, they came running to the spot and cried aloud: ‘The wolf
is dead! The wolf is dead!’ and danced for joy round about the well with
their mother.",1110,Volk_in_sedem_kozic,"Bila je nekoč stara koza. Imela je sedem mladih kozic, ki jih je imela rada, kakor ima rada mati svoje otroke. Nekega dne je nameravala iti v gozd po malo krme in je sklicala vseh sedem kozic ter jim dejala: »Dragi otroci, jaz moram v gozd. Pazite se volka. Če pride, vas bo vse požrl s kožo in kostmi. Ta malopridnež se večkrat pretvarja, toda po njegovem raskavem glasu in po njegovih črnih šapah ga boste pr&ej spoznali.« »Dragi mati,« so rekle kozice, »saj bomo lepo pazile, brez skrbi greš lahko z doma.« Stara je zameketala in se mirno odpravila na pot. Ni dolgo trajalo, ko je že nekdo potrkal na hišna vrata in zaklical: »Odprite, ljubi otroci, vaša mamica je prišla in je vsakemu nekaj prinesla.« Kozice pa so spoznale po raskavem glasu, da je volk. »Ne bomo ti odprle!« so odgovorile, »ti nisi naša mati, ta ima mil in ljubek glas, tvoj glas pa je osoren. Ti si volk.« Nato je volk odšel h kramarju in si kupil velik kos krede, ter ga pogoltnil, da mu je glas mileje zvenel. Zatem se je vrnil, potrkal na hišne duri in zaklical: »Odprite, ljubi otroci, vaša mati se je vrnila in je vsakemu nekaj prinesla.« Toda volk je položil svojo črno šapo na okno in ko so otroci to opazili, so rekli: »Ne bomo odprli! Naša mati nima tako črnih nog kakor ti. Ti si volk.« 

Nato je stekel volk k peku in zavzdihnil: »Udaril sem se v nogo, namaži mi jo s testom.« In ko mu je pek namazal nogo, je volk stekel k mlinarju in mu dejal: »Nasuj mi bele moke na sapo.« Mlinar je pomislil: »Tale volk bi rad nekoga preslepil,« in se je uprl. Volk pa mu je zagrozil, da ga bo raztrgal, če ne stori tega. Mlinar se je prestrašil in mu natresel bele moke na šapo. Saj, taki so ljudje! Zdaj je šel malopridnež tretjič k hišnim vratom, potrkal in nežno dejal: »Odprite, otročički! Vaša mamica je prišla domov in je vsakemu nekaj prinesla iz gozda.« Kozice so zaklicale: »Pokaži nam najprej svojo šapo, da bomo vedele, če si res naša draga mamica.« Volk je položil šapo na okno in ko so videle, da je bela, so mislile, da je vse res, kar je dejal, in so odprle vrata. In kdo je vstopil? Volk! Hudo so se prestrašile in so se hotele poskriti. Ena je skočila pod mizo, druga v posteljo, tretja v peč, četrta v kuhinjo, peta v omaro, šesta pod umivalnik, sedma v omarico stenske ure. Volk pa jih je našel, vse, in jih brez pomisleka drugo za drugo požrl; edino najmlajše, tiste v novi omarici, ni našel. Ko si je volk potešil svojo lakoto, je odšel, legel na travo pod drevo in zaspal. Kmalu zatem se vrne stara koza iz gozda. Ah, kakšna slika se je prikazala njenim. očem! Hišne duri nastežaj odprte, miza, stoli in klopi prevrnjeni, skleda za umivanje je bila iv črepinjah, odeja in blazine so bile vse razmetane. Začela je iskati svoje otroke, a nikjer jih ni bilo. Klicala jih je po vrsti z imeni, a nobena se ji ni oglasila. Nazadnje šele, ko je poklicala najmlajšo, je zaklical droben glasek: »Mamica, tukaj sem, v omarici za uro.« 

Rešila je kozico iz omarice in ta ji je povedala, da je prišel volk in vse druge požrl. Lahko si mislite, kako se je koza jokala zaradi svojih ubogih otrok. svoji veliki žalosti je naposled odšla iz hiše in najmlajša kozica je stekla za njo. Na travniku je zagledala volka, ki je ležal pod drevesom in smrčal, da so se kar veje tresle. Začela ga je z vseh strani ogledovati in je videla, da se mu v napihnjenem trebuhu nekaj giblje in cepeta. »Mili bog,« je pomislila, »kaj če so moji ubogi otroci, ki jih je požrl, še pri življenju?« Pri priči je morala mlada kozica steči domov in prinesti škarje, šivanko in sukanec. Potem je stara zverini razparala polni trebuh in komaj je zarezala, že je pokukala iz njega glava mlade kozice. Ko je dalje rezala, je poskakalo iz njega vseh šestero kozic in bile so še vse žive in nepoškodovane. Zver jih je namreč v svoji požrešnosti kar cele pogoltnila. To vam je bilo veselje! Objemale so svojo drago mamico in poskakovale kakor krojaček na svatbi. Mati je dejala: »Pojdite zdaj in prinesite nekaj velikih kamnov, da bomo z njimi tej hudobni živali napolnile trebuh, dokler še spi in smrči.« In vseh sedem kozic je hitro privleklo kamenje, ki so ga stlačile volku v trebuh, kolikor ga je le šlo vanj. Nato ga je stara spet hitro zašila, da ni ničesar opazil in se niti zganil ni. Ko se je volk končno naspal, se je skobacal na noge in ker ga je kamenje v želodcu tako hudo žejalo, je hotel piti iz bliž-njega vodnjaka. Ko pa je začel stopati in se premikati, se je zadevalo kamenje v njegovem trebuhu in trkalo drug ob dru-gega. In volk je jezno zarenčal: »Kaj tako se po trebuhu mi z ropotom kotali? Šest kozličev sem požrl, zdaj kot kamen so težki.« 

Ko je prišel do vodnjaka in se nagnil nad vodo, da bi pil, so ga težki kamni potegnili vanjo. Štrbunknil je v vodnjak in klavrno utonil. Ko so kozice to videle, so pritekle in na ves glas zavriskale: »Volk je mrtev, volk je mrtev!« In od veselja so s svojo mamico zaplesale okrog vodnjaka.

9,THE FOUR CLEVER BROTHERS,"‘Dear children,’ said a poor man to his four sons, ‘I have nothing to
give you; you must go out into the wide world and try your luck. Begin
by learning some craft or another, and see how you can get on.’ So the
four brothers took their walking-sticks in their hands, and their little
bundles on their shoulders, and after bidding their father goodbye, went
all out at the gate together. When they had got on some way they came
to four crossways, each leading to a different country. Then the eldest
said, ‘Here we must part; but this day four years we will come back
to this spot, and in the meantime each must try what he can do for
himself.’

So each brother went his way; and as the eldest was hastening on a man
met him, and asked him where he was going, and what he wanted. ‘I am
going to try my luck in the world, and should like to begin by learning
some art or trade,’ answered he. ‘Then,’ said the man, ‘go with me, and
I will teach you to become the cunningest thief that ever was.’ ‘No,’
said the other, ‘that is not an honest calling, and what can one look
to earn by it in the end but the gallows?’ ‘Oh!’ said the man, ‘you need
not fear the gallows; for I will only teach you to steal what will be
fair game: I meddle with nothing but what no one else can get or care
anything about, and where no one can find you out.’ So the young man
agreed to follow his trade, and he soon showed himself so clever, that
nothing could escape him that he had once set his mind upon.

The second brother also met a man, who, when he found out what he was
setting out upon, asked him what craft he meant to follow. ‘I do not
know yet,’ said he. ‘Then come with me, and be a star-gazer. It is a
noble art, for nothing can be hidden from you, when once you understand
the stars.’ The plan pleased him much, and he soon became such a skilful
star-gazer, that when he had served out his time, and wanted to leave
his master, he gave him a glass, and said, ‘With this you can see all
that is passing in the sky and on earth, and nothing can be hidden from
you.’

The third brother met a huntsman, who took him with him, and taught him
so well all that belonged to hunting, that he became very clever in the
craft of the woods; and when he left his master he gave him a bow, and
said, ‘Whatever you shoot at with this bow you will be sure to hit.’

The youngest brother likewise met a man who asked him what he wished to
do. ‘Would not you like,’ said he, ‘to be a tailor?’ ‘Oh, no!’ said
the young man; ‘sitting cross-legged from morning to night, working
backwards and forwards with a needle and goose, will never suit me.’
‘Oh!’ answered the man, ‘that is not my sort of tailoring; come with me,
and you will learn quite another kind of craft from that.’ Not knowing
what better to do, he came into the plan, and learnt tailoring from the
beginning; and when he left his master, he gave him a needle, and said,
‘You can sew anything with this, be it as soft as an egg or as hard as
steel; and the joint will be so fine that no seam will be seen.’

After the space of four years, at the time agreed upon, the four
brothers met at the four cross-roads; and having welcomed each other,
set off towards their father’s home, where they told him all that had
happened to them, and how each had learned some craft.

Then, one day, as they were sitting before the house under a very high
tree, the father said, ‘I should like to try what each of you can do in
this way.’ So he looked up, and said to the second son, ‘At the top of
this tree there is a chaffinch’s nest; tell me how many eggs there are
in it.’ The star-gazer took his glass, looked up, and said, ‘Five.’
‘Now,’ said the father to the eldest son, ‘take away the eggs without
letting the bird that is sitting upon them and hatching them know
anything of what you are doing.’ So the cunning thief climbed up the
tree, and brought away to his father the five eggs from under the bird;
and it never saw or felt what he was doing, but kept sitting on at its
ease. Then the father took the eggs, and put one on each corner of the
table, and the fifth in the middle, and said to the huntsman, ‘Cut all
the eggs in two pieces at one shot.’ The huntsman took up his bow, and
at one shot struck all the five eggs as his father wished.

‘Now comes your turn,’ said he to the young tailor; ‘sew the eggs and
the young birds in them together again, so neatly that the shot shall
have done them no harm.’ Then the tailor took his needle, and sewed the
eggs as he was told; and when he had done, the thief was sent to take
them back to the nest, and put them under the bird without its knowing
it. Then she went on sitting, and hatched them: and in a few days they
crawled out, and had only a little red streak across their necks, where
the tailor had sewn them together.

‘Well done, sons!’ said the old man; ‘you have made good use of your
time, and learnt something worth the knowing; but I am sure I do not
know which ought to have the prize. Oh, that a time might soon come for
you to turn your skill to some account!’

Not long after this there was a great bustle in the country; for the
king’s daughter had been carried off by a mighty dragon, and the king
mourned over his loss day and night, and made it known that whoever
brought her back to him should have her for a wife. Then the four
brothers said to each other, ‘Here is a chance for us; let us try
what we can do.’ And they agreed to see whether they could not set the
princess free. ‘I will soon find out where she is, however,’ said the
star-gazer, as he looked through his glass; and he soon cried out, ‘I
see her afar off, sitting upon a rock in the sea, and I can spy the
dragon close by, guarding her.’ Then he went to the king, and asked for
a ship for himself and his brothers; and they sailed together over the
sea, till they came to the right place. There they found the princess
sitting, as the star-gazer had said, on the rock; and the dragon was
lying asleep, with his head upon her lap. ‘I dare not shoot at him,’
said the huntsman, ‘for I should kill the beautiful young lady also.’
‘Then I will try my skill,’ said the thief, and went and stole her away
from under the dragon, so quietly and gently that the beast did not know
it, but went on snoring.

Then away they hastened with her full of joy in their boat towards the
ship; but soon came the dragon roaring behind them through the air; for
he awoke and missed the princess. But when he got over the boat, and
wanted to pounce upon them and carry off the princess, the huntsman took
up his bow and shot him straight through the heart so that he fell down
dead. They were still not safe; for he was such a great beast that in
his fall he overset the boat, and they had to swim in the open sea
upon a few planks. So the tailor took his needle, and with a few large
stitches put some of the planks together; and he sat down upon these,
and sailed about and gathered up all pieces of the boat; and then tacked
them together so quickly that the boat was soon ready, and they then
reached the ship and got home safe.

When they had brought home the princess to her father, there was great
rejoicing; and he said to the four brothers, ‘One of you shall marry
her, but you must settle amongst yourselves which it is to be.’ Then
there arose a quarrel between them; and the star-gazer said, ‘If I had
not found the princess out, all your skill would have been of no use;
therefore she ought to be mine.’ ‘Your seeing her would have been of
no use,’ said the thief, ‘if I had not taken her away from the dragon;
therefore she ought to be mine.’ ‘No, she is mine,’ said the huntsman;
‘for if I had not killed the dragon, he would, after all, have torn you
and the princess into pieces.’ ‘And if I had not sewn the boat together
again,’ said the tailor, ‘you would all have been drowned, therefore she
is mine.’ Then the king put in a word, and said, ‘Each of you is right;
and as all cannot have the young lady, the best way is for neither of
you to have her: for the truth is, there is somebody she likes a great
deal better. But to make up for your loss, I will give each of you, as a
reward for his skill, half a kingdom.’ So the brothers agreed that this
plan would be much better than either quarrelling or marrying a lady who
had no mind to have them. And the king then gave to each half a kingdom,
as he had said; and they lived very happily the rest of their days, and
took good care of their father; and somebody took better care of the
young lady, than to let either the dragon or one of the craftsmen have
her again.",1710,Stirje_izuceni_bratje,"Bil je reven mož, ki je imel štiri sinove. Ko so odrasli, jim je dejal: »Ljubi moji sinovi, po svetu morate, jaz nimam ničesar, kar bi vam dal. Pripravite se in pojdite na tuje, izučite se kakšnega rokodelstva in glejte, kako se boste prebili.« Bratje so vzeli popotne palice v roke, se poslovili od svojega očeta ter odšli skozi mestna vrata. Ko so nekaj časa romali, so prišli do križišča, ki je držalo na štiri različne strani. »Tukaj se moramo ločiti,« je rekel najstarejši, »a čez štiri leta obsorej se spet dobimo. Medtem pa poskusimo svojo srečo.« Tako so ubrali vsak svojo pot. Pa je srečal najstarejšega brata človek, ki ga je vprašal, kam hoče in kaj namerava. »Rokodelstva se grem učit,« je rekel on. »Pojdi z menoj in postani tat!« je rekel človek. »Ne,« je odgovoril brat, »to ni pošteno rokodelstvo. In konec pesmice je zmerom ta, da uporabijo nazadnje človeka kje pod milim nebom za kembelj pri zvonu.« »Kaj še,« je rekel človek, »vislic se ti ni treba bati. Jaz te naučim samo, da dobiš v roke to, česar noben človek ne more dobiti in da ti nihče ne pride na sled.« Dal se je pregovoriti, se izučil za tatu in je postal tako spreten, da ni bilo nič varno pred njim, kar je hotel dobiti. Tudi drugi brat je srečal človeka, ki ga je vprašal, kaj se gre učit. »Saj še sam ne vem,« je rekel ta. 

»Pa pojdi z menoj in postani zvezdogledec. Nič ni boljšega kakor to. Človeku ne ostane nič skritega na svetu.« Temu je bilo to všeč in postal je tako spreten zvezdogledec, da mu je njegov mojster, ko se je izučil in hotel iti dalje, dal daljnogled ter mu rekel: »S tem zagledaš vse, kar se godi na zemlji in na nebu in ti ne more ostati nič skritega.« Tretjega brata je vzel neki lovec v uk in ga tako dobro izučil v vsem, kar spada k lovu, da je postal res dober. Pri slovesu mu je mojster podaril puško in dejal: »Ta ne zgreši nikdar, karkoli vzameš na muho, zanesljivo zadeneš z njo.« Tudi najmlajši brat je srečal človeka, ki ga je nagovoril in vprašal, kaj namerava. »Te ne bi mikalo postati krojač?« ga je vprašal. »Ne mika me,« je odgovoril najmlajši. »Tisto posedanje s krivim hrbtom od jutra do večera, pa tisto šviganje s šivanko, pa tisti likalnik mi še na misel ne pridejo.« »Eh, kaj,« je rekel človek, »govoriš pač, kakor veš. Pri meni bi se izučil čisto drugačne krojaške umetnosti, ki je dostojna in velika in celo zelo častivredna.« Tako se je dal pregovoriti, šel je z njim in se korenito izučil krojaške umetnosti. Pri slovesu mu je dal mojster šivanko in rekel: »S to šivanko lahko sešiješ, karkoli ti pride pod roko, pa če je tako mehko kakor jajce ali pa tako trdo kakor jeklo. In sešito bo kakor en kos, niti šiva ne bo videti.« Ko so minila dogovorjena štiri leta, so se bratje sešli na križišču, kot so se bili zmenili, se prisrčno pozdravili in odšli domov k očetu. »No,« je veselo rekel oče, »vas je spet prinesel veter k meni.« Povedali so mu, kako se jim je godilo in da se je vsakdo izučil svojega rokodelstva. Sedeli pa so ravno pred hišo pod 

visokim drevesom, zato je oče dejal: »Rad bi vas preskusil in videl, kaj znate.« Ozrl se je kvišku in rekel drugemu sinu: »Tamle na vrhu drevesa je med dvema vejama ščinkavčevo gnezdo, povej mi, koliko jajc je v njem?« Zvezdogledec je vzel daljnogled, pogledal tja gor in rekel: »Pet jih je.« Oče je rekel najstarejšemu: »Splezaj in prinesi jajčka, a tako, da ščinkavca, ki sedi na njih in vali, ne boš zmotil pri tem.« Zvedeni tat je splezal na drevo in ptiču, ki ni niti opazil in je mirno sedel dalje, vzel pet jajčk ter jih prinesel očetu. Oče jih je vzel, jih položil na mizo, vsakega v en kot in petega v sredo ter velel lovcu: »Prestreli vseh pet jajčk z enim strelom ravno po sredini.« Lovec je naravnal puško ter prestrelil vseh pet jajčk, kakor je ukazal oče, in sicer z enim samim strelom. Gotovo je imel smodnik, ki strelja okrog vogala. »Zdaj pride vrsta nate,« je rekel oče četrtemu sinu: »Sešij jajčka nazaj, pa tudi mladiče, ki so v njih, in sicer tako, da se jim strel ne bo poznal.« Krojač je storil, kakor je zahteval oče. Ko je končal, je moral tat odnesti jajčka spet nazaj na drevo v gnezdo in jih podložiti ščinkavki tako, da ne bi ničesar zapazila. Ščinkavka jih je zvalila in čez nekaj dni so prilezli mladički iz lupin in imeli tam, kjer jih je krojač šival, rdečo progo okrog vratu. »Res,« je dejal oče. »Reči moram, da niste od muh. Dobro ste porabili svoj čas in se nekaj poštenega izučili. Sam ne vem, komu bi dal prednost. Ko bi le kmalu našli pravo priložnost pokazati svojo umetnost, tedaj bi se ižkazalo.« 

Kmalu zatem je nastala v deželi velika zmeda. Kraljevo hčerko je ugrabil zmaj! Kralj je bil zaradi tega noč in dan v skrbeh. Razglasiti je dal, da jo bo tistemu, ki jo privede nazaj, dal za ženo. Bratje so stopili in se posvetovali: »To je priložnost, ko se lahko izkažemo.« Namenili so oditi skupaj in osvoboditi kraljično. »Kje je, bom kmalu zvedel,« je rekel zvezdogledec. Vzel je svoj daljnogled, pogledal in dejal: »Jo že vidim. Daleč tam zunaj sedi na skali v morju in zraven nje je zmaj, ki. jo straži.« Nato je šel h kralju ter prosil ladjo zase in za svoje brate. Odpeljali so se skupaj na morje do skale, kjer je sedela kraljična. Zmaj pa je ležal v njenem naročju in spal. »Streljati ne smem,« je rekel lovec, »ker bi z zmajem vred ustrelil tudi zalo deklico.« »Torej poskusim jaz svojo umetnost,« je dejal tat. Splazil se je k skali in jo ugrabil zmaju tako tiho in ročno, da ta ni nič opazil in je še naprej smrčal kakor prej. Bratje so vsi veseli odhiteli z njo na ladjo ter zajadrali na odprto morje. Ko pa se je zmaj prebudil in opazil, da ni več kraljične pri njem, je naglo priplaval za njimi ter besno puhal skozi nos. Ko pa se je ravno dvignil nad ladjo in se hotel vreči nanjo, je lovec nastavil puško ter ga ustrelil naravnost v srce. Zmaj je obležal mrtev. Bil pa je tako velik in silen, da je pri padcu raztreščil vso ladjo. Bratje so srečno ujeli še nekaj desk, ki so se jih oklenili in plavali po širokem morju. V tej hudi stiski pa je krojač, ne bodi len, vzel svojo čudežno šivanko, sešil v največji naglici z nekaj velikimi šivi deske drugo k drugi, sedel nanje in zbral j ladijske kose. Nato je sešil še te, da je bila v kratkem času ladja spet dobra za jadranje. In tako so se lahko srečno vrnili domov. 

Ko je kralj spet zagledal svojo hčer, je zavladalo veliko veselje. Bratom pa je dejal: »Eden izmed vas naj jo dobi za ženo, udiočite se sami med 4,eboj.« Tedaj je nastal hud spor med njimi, kajti vsak jo je hotel dobiti zase. Zvezdogledec je rekel: »Če jaz kraljične ne bi bil opazil, bi bile vse vaše umetnosti zaman. Zato je moja.« Tat pa je rekel: »Če bi je jaz ne izmaknil zmaju, bi vam vse nič ne pomagalo! Zato je moja.« Lovec pa: »Saj bi vas bil zmaj s kraljično vred raztrgal, če ga jaz ne hi bil zadel s kroglo. Zato je moja.« Krojač je rekel: »In če vam jaz ne bi bil skrpal ladje, bi bili klavrno utonili. Zato je moja.« Ko je bilo tako, je odločil kralj: »Vsakdo izmed vas ima enako pravico, a ker vsakdo deklice ne more dobiti, je ne bo dobil nobeden izmed vas. Za nagrado pa dam nji in vam vsakemu del kraljestva.« Odločitev  je ugajala bratom in rekli so: »Bolje je tako, kakor pa da bi se sprli.« Tako je dobil vsak en del kraljestva. In živeli so srečni in zadovoljni s svojim očetom še veliko let. ",1351
10,THE GOLDEN GOOSE,"There was a man who had three sons, the youngest of whom was called
Dummling,[*] and was despised, mocked, and sneered at on every occasion.

It happened that the eldest wanted to go into the forest to hew wood,
and before he went his mother gave him a beautiful sweet cake and a
bottle of wine in order that he might not suffer from hunger or thirst.

When he entered the forest he met a little grey-haired old man who bade
him good day, and said: ‘Do give me a piece of cake out of your pocket,
and let me have a draught of your wine; I am so hungry and thirsty.’ But
the clever son answered: ‘If I give you my cake and wine, I shall have
none for myself; be off with you,’ and he left the little man standing
and went on.

But when he began to hew down a tree, it was not long before he made a
false stroke, and the axe cut him in the arm, so that he had to go home
and have it bound up. And this was the little grey man’s doing.

After this the second son went into the forest, and his mother gave him,
like the eldest, a cake and a bottle of wine. The little old grey man
met him likewise, and asked him for a piece of cake and a drink of wine.
But the second son, too, said sensibly enough: ‘What I give you will be
taken away from myself; be off!’ and he left the little man standing and
went on. His punishment, however, was not delayed; when he had made a
few blows at the tree he struck himself in the leg, so that he had to be
carried home.

Then Dummling said: ‘Father, do let me go and cut wood.’ The father
answered: ‘Your brothers have hurt themselves with it, leave it alone,
you do not understand anything about it.’ But Dummling begged so long
that at last he said: ‘Just go then, you will get wiser by hurting
yourself.’ His mother gave him a cake made with water and baked in the
cinders, and with it a bottle of sour beer.

When he came to the forest the little old grey man met him likewise,
and greeting him, said: ‘Give me a piece of your cake and a drink out
of your bottle; I am so hungry and thirsty.’ Dummling answered: ‘I have
only cinder-cake and sour beer; if that pleases you, we will sit
down and eat.’ So they sat down, and when Dummling pulled out his
cinder-cake, it was a fine sweet cake, and the sour beer had become good
wine. So they ate and drank, and after that the little man said: ‘Since
you have a good heart, and are willing to divide what you have, I will
give you good luck. There stands an old tree, cut it down, and you will
find something at the roots.’ Then the little man took leave of him.

Dummling went and cut down the tree, and when it fell there was a goose
sitting in the roots with feathers of pure gold. He lifted her up, and
taking her with him, went to an inn where he thought he would stay the
night. Now the host had three daughters, who saw the goose and were
curious to know what such a wonderful bird might be, and would have
liked to have one of its golden feathers.

The eldest thought: ‘I shall soon find an opportunity of pulling out a
feather,’ and as soon as Dummling had gone out she seized the goose by
the wing, but her finger and hand remained sticking fast to it.

The second came soon afterwards, thinking only of how she might get a
feather for herself, but she had scarcely touched her sister than she
was held fast.

At last the third also came with the like intent, and the others
screamed out: ‘Keep away; for goodness’ sake keep away!’ But she did
not understand why she was to keep away. ‘The others are there,’ she
thought, ‘I may as well be there too,’ and ran to them; but as soon as
she had touched her sister, she remained sticking fast to her. So they
had to spend the night with the goose.

The next morning Dummling took the goose under his arm and set out,
without troubling himself about the three girls who were hanging on to
it. They were obliged to run after him continually, now left, now right,
wherever his legs took him.

In the middle of the fields the parson met them, and when he saw the
procession he said: ‘For shame, you good-for-nothing girls, why are you
running across the fields after this young man? Is that seemly?’ At the
same time he seized the youngest by the hand in order to pull her away,
but as soon as he touched her he likewise stuck fast, and was himself
obliged to run behind.

Before long the sexton came by and saw his master, the parson, running
behind three girls. He was astonished at this and called out: ‘Hi!
your reverence, whither away so quickly? Do not forget that we have a
christening today!’ and running after him he took him by the sleeve, but
was also held fast to it.

Whilst the five were trotting thus one behind the other, two labourers
came with their hoes from the fields; the parson called out to them
and begged that they would set him and the sexton free. But they had
scarcely touched the sexton when they were held fast, and now there were
seven of them running behind Dummling and the goose.

Soon afterwards he came to a city, where a king ruled who had a daughter
who was so serious that no one could make her laugh. So he had put forth
a decree that whosoever should be able to make her laugh should marry
her. When Dummling heard this, he went with his goose and all her train
before the king’s daughter, and as soon as she saw the seven people
running on and on, one behind the other, she began to laugh quite
loudly, and as if she would never stop. Thereupon Dummling asked to have
her for his wife; but the king did not like the son-in-law, and made all
manner of excuses and said he must first produce a man who could drink
a cellarful of wine. Dummling thought of the little grey man, who could
certainly help him; so he went into the forest, and in the same place
where he had felled the tree, he saw a man sitting, who had a very
sorrowful face. Dummling asked him what he was taking to heart so
sorely, and he answered: ‘I have such a great thirst and cannot quench
it; cold water I cannot stand, a barrel of wine I have just emptied, but
that to me is like a drop on a hot stone!’

‘There, I can help you,’ said Dummling, ‘just come with me and you shall
be satisfied.’

He led him into the king’s cellar, and the man bent over the huge
barrels, and drank and drank till his loins hurt, and before the day was
out he had emptied all the barrels. Then Dummling asked once more
for his bride, but the king was vexed that such an ugly fellow, whom
everyone called Dummling, should take away his daughter, and he made a
new condition; he must first find a man who could eat a whole mountain
of bread. Dummling did not think long, but went straight into the
forest, where in the same place there sat a man who was tying up his
body with a strap, and making an awful face, and saying: ‘I have eaten a
whole ovenful of rolls, but what good is that when one has such a hunger
as I? My stomach remains empty, and I must tie myself up if I am not to
die of hunger.’

At this Dummling was glad, and said: ‘Get up and come with me; you shall
eat yourself full.’ He led him to the king’s palace where all the
flour in the whole Kingdom was collected, and from it he caused a huge
mountain of bread to be baked. The man from the forest stood before it,
began to eat, and by the end of one day the whole mountain had vanished.
Then Dummling for the third time asked for his bride; but the king again
sought a way out, and ordered a ship which could sail on land and on
water. ‘As soon as you come sailing back in it,’ said he, ‘you shall
have my daughter for wife.’

Dummling went straight into the forest, and there sat the little grey
man to whom he had given his cake. When he heard what Dummling wanted,
he said: ‘Since you have given me to eat and to drink, I will give you
the ship; and I do all this because you once were kind to me.’ Then he
gave him the ship which could sail on land and water, and when the king
saw that, he could no longer prevent him from having his daughter. The
wedding was celebrated, and after the king’s death, Dummling inherited
his kingdom and lived for a long time contentedly with his wife.

     [*] Simpleton",1593,Zlata_goska,"Bil je človek, ki je imel tri sinove. Najmlajšemu izmed njih so rekli Tepček. Vsi v hiši so ga zaničevali in zasmehovali ter ga ob vsaki priložnosti zapostavljali. Zgodilo se je, da je hotel iti najstarejši sin v gozd sekat drva. Pred odhodom mu je mati dala kos lepega slastnega kolača iz jajc in masla ter steklenico vina, da ne bi bil lačen in žejen. Ko je prišel v gozd, je srečal starega sivega možička, ki mu je voščil dober dan in dejal: »Daj mi košček kolača iz svojega žepa in dovoli mi požirek vina. Tako hudo sem lačen in žejen.« »Če ti dam kolača in vina, mi samemu ne ostane nič. Pojdi svojo pot!« je rekel pametni sin, pustil moža na poti in šel dalje. Ko se je nato lotil drevesa, ni dolgo trajalo, da je sekira zgrešila in ga zadela v roko, tako da je moral oditi domov in si obvezati rano. Nato je šel drugi sin v gozd. Mati mu je dala, kakor najstarejšemu sinu, jajčni kolač in steklenico vina. Ta je prav tako srečal starega sivega možička, ki ga je poprosil za košček kolača in požirek vina. Toda tudi drugi sin je rekel kar pametno: »Kar dam tebi, bom sam pogrešal, pojdi svojo pot!« Pustil je možička na poti in odšel. Kazen pa ni izostala. Ko je nekajkrat zasekal v deblo, se je usekal v nogo, da so ga morali prenesti domov. 

Tedaj je dejal Tepček: »Oče, Pustite mene v gozd sekat drva.« »Tvoja dva brata sta se že poškodovala, nik vtikaj v to, saj ne znaš,« je odgovoril oče. ar se še ti ne Tepček pa je le prosil in prosil, da je oče nazadnje dejal: »Fa pojdi, nesreča te bo že spametovala.« Mati mu je dala kos v pepelu pečenega kolača iz vode in moke in steklenico kislega piva. Ko je prišel v gozd, je srečal starega sivega možička, ki ga je pozdravil in mu je rekel: »Daj mi košček svojega kolača in požirek iz steklenice, tako zelo sem lačen in žejen.« »Toda jaz imam samo pepelnat kolač in kislo pivo, če ti je to prav, lahko sedeva in pojeva,« je odgovoril Tepček. Pa sta sedla in glej, ko je Tepček vzel v roke svoj pepelnati kolač, je bil to slasten jajčni kolač, kislo pivo pa dobro vino. Najedla sta se in napila, nato pa je rekel možiček: »Ker imaš dobro srce in rad deliš z drugimi, kar imaš, ti bom daroval srečo. Glej tamle ono staro drevo. Posekaj ga in pod njegovimi koreninami boš nekaj našel.« Rekel je sivček in izginil. Tepček je šel in posekal drevo. Ko je padlo, pa je sedela med koreninami goska, ki je imela perje iz suhega zlata. Dvignil jo je, jo vzel s seboj ter šel v krčmo, kjer je hotel prenočiti. Krčmar je imel tri hčere, ki so videle gosko in bile radovedne, kakšna ptica je to. Vsaka bi hotela imeti kakšno njeno zlato pero. Najstarejša hči je pomislila: »Se bo že našla priložnost, da izpulim goski kakšno pero.« In ko je Tepček stopil malo ven, je prijela gosko za perut, prsti in roka pa so se ji še isti trenutek prilepili nanjo. Kmalu zatem je prišla druga hči, ki tudi ni imela druge misli, kakor da bi si izpulila kakšno zlato pero. Komaj pa se je dotaknila sestre, je bila prilepljena k njej. 

Nazadnje je prišla še tretja hči z istim namenom. Onidve sta zavpili: »Ne dotikaj se! Ne, ne, nikar se ne dotikaj!« Ona pa ni razumela, zakaj se ne bi dotaknila in je mislila: »Če sta se onidve lahko dotaknili, se tudi jaz lahko!« Priskočila je in toliko da se je dotaknila sestre, je že obvisela na njej. Tako so morale vse tri sestre prebiti noč pri goski. Drugo jutro je vzel Tepček gosko pod pazduho, odšel in se ni menil za tri dekleta, ki so bile prilepljene zraven. Morale so lepo tekati za njim, zdaj levo, zdaj desno, kamor so njega noge nosile. Sredi polja jih je srečal župnik. Ko je videl sprevod, je dejal: »Sram vas bodi, dekline grde, da se ženete po polju za mladim fantom. Ali se to spodobi?« S temi besedami je prijel najmlajšo za roko in jo hotel potegniti nazaj. Ko pa se je je dotaknil, je še sam obvisel na njej in moral je teči v sprevodu. Kmalu zatem je prišel po poti cerkovnik. Videl je gospoda župnika, ki je stopal dekletom za krilom: »Ej, ej, gospod župnik, kam pa tako naglo? Ne pozabite, da imate danes še opravke!« je vzkliknil začudeno. Pohitel je k njemu in ga prijel za rokav. Ko pa se ga je dotaknil, je tudi sam obvisel na njem. Ko je vseh petero tako dirjalo drug za drugim, sta prišla s polja dva kmeta s svojimi motikami. Župnik ju je poprosil, naj osvobodita njega in cerkovnika. Komaj pa sta se dotaknila cerkovnika, sta obvisela. Tako jih je bilo zdaj sedem, ki so tekli za Tepčkom z gosko. Tako je prišel kmalu zatem Tepček z vsem spremstvom v neko mesto. Tam je vladal kralj, ki je imel tako resno hčerko, da je nihče na svetu ni mogel pripraviti, da bi se zasmejala. Zato je izdal zakon, da jo bo tisti, ki jo pripravi do smeha, dobil za ženo. 

Tepček je to slišal in odšel s svojo gosko in njenimi priveski pred kraljevo hčer. Ko je kraljična zagledala ta smešni sprevod, se je začela ves glas smejati, da kar ni mogla nehati. Tepček jo je zato zahteval za nevesto. Kralju pa ta zet ni bil všeč, zato se je izmikal in izmikal. Dejal je, da mu mora poprej pripeljati še človeka, ki bi mogel izpiti polno klet vina. Tepček je pomislil na sivega možička. Ta edini bi mu lahko pomagal. Šel je v gozd in na mestu, kjer je posekal drevo, je zagledal moža, ki je imel hudo žalosten obraz. Tepček ga je vprašal, kaj si tako žene k srcu. »Tako zelo sem žejen in se ne morem napiti. Mrzle vode ne prenašam. Izpraznil sem sicer sod vina, a kaj je kapljica na razbeljeni kamen?« je odgovoril mož. »Potlej ti jaz lahko pomagam,« je rekel Tepček. »Pojdi z menoj, do sitega se boš napil.« Odpeljal ga je nato v kraljevo klet. Mož se je lotil ogromnih sodov in pil je in pil, da ga je v bokih bolelo. A še preden je minil dan, je izpil vso klet. Tepček je spet zahteval svojo nevesto. Kralj pa je bil jezen, da bi takle navaden fantin, ki mu ves svet ne pravi drugače kakor Tepček, odpeljal njegovo hčerko. Zato je postavil nove pogoje: poprej mora poiskati še človeka, ki bo mogel pojesti celo goro kruha. Tepček ni dolgo pomišljal in je šel precej v gozd. Tu je na istem mestu sedel mož, ki se je z jermenom prepasoval čez pas ter imel hudo čemeren obraz. »Pojedel sem že celo krušno peč ovsenjaka, a kaj zaleže to, če ima človek tako lakoto kakor jaz. Želodec mi je čisto prazen in z jermenom si moram zadrgniti pas, da ne umrjem od lakote,« je rekel možak. Tepček se je zelo razveselil in rekel: »Vstani in pojdi z menoj, do sitega se boš najedel.« 

Povedel ga je na kraljevi dvor. Kralj pa je dal medtem navoziti moke iz vsega kraljestva in dal speči iz nje velikansko goro kruha. Mož iz gozda se je postavil pred to goro in začel jesti. Jedel je in v enem dnevu je gora izginila. Tepček je v tretje zahteval svojo nevesto, kralj pa se je še enkrat skušal izviti. Zahteval je ladjo, ki bi mogla voziti po kopnem in po vodi. »Ko boš prijadral s to ladjo,« je rekel, »boš precej dobil mojo hčer za ženo.« Tepček je odšel naravnost v gozd. Tam je sedel tisti stari, sivi možiček, kateremu je bil dal svoj kolač. »Jedel in pil sem zate,« je rekel, »in dal ti bom tudi ladjo. Vse to pa zato, ker si pokazal, da imaš blago srce.« Dal mu je tudi ladjo, ki je vozila po kopnem in po vodi. Ko je kralj to videl, mu ni mogel več odreči hčere. Obhajali so svatbo. Ko pa je kralj umrl, je Tepček podedoval kraljestvo in preživel je veliko let v sreči in zadovoljstvu s svojo ženo.

11,THE TWELVE HUNTSMEN,"There was once a king’s son who had a bride whom he loved very much. And
when he was sitting beside her and very happy, news came that his father
lay sick unto death, and desired to see him once again before his end.
Then he said to his beloved: ‘I must now go and leave you, I give you
a ring as a remembrance of me. When I am king, I will return and fetch
you.’ So he rode away, and when he reached his father, the latter was
dangerously ill, and near his death. He said to him: ‘Dear son, I wished
to see you once again before my end, promise me to marry as I wish,’ and
he named a certain king’s daughter who was to be his wife. The son was
in such trouble that he did not think what he was doing, and said: ‘Yes,
dear father, your will shall be done,’ and thereupon the king shut his
eyes, and died.

When therefore the son had been proclaimed king, and the time of
mourning was over, he was forced to keep the promise which he had given
his father, and caused the king’s daughter to be asked in marriage, and
she was promised to him. His first betrothed heard of this, and fretted
so much about his faithfulness that she nearly died. Then her father
said to her: ‘Dearest child, why are you so sad? You shall have
whatsoever you will.’ She thought for a moment and said: ‘Dear father,
I wish for eleven girls exactly like myself in face, figure, and size.’
The father said: ‘If it be possible, your desire shall be fulfilled,’
and he caused a search to be made in his whole kingdom, until eleven
young maidens were found who exactly resembled his daughter in face,
figure, and size.

When they came to the king’s daughter, she had twelve suits of
huntsmen’s clothes made, all alike, and the eleven maidens had to put
on the huntsmen’s clothes, and she herself put on the twelfth suit.
Thereupon she took her leave of her father, and rode away with them,
and rode to the court of her former betrothed, whom she loved so dearly.
Then she asked if he required any huntsmen, and if he would take all of
them into his service. The king looked at her and did not know her, but
as they were such handsome fellows, he said: ‘Yes,’ and that he would
willingly take them, and now they were the king’s twelve huntsmen.

The king, however, had a lion which was a wondrous animal, for he knew
all concealed and secret things. It came to pass that one evening he
said to the king: ‘You think you have twelve huntsmen?’ ‘Yes,’ said the
king, ‘they are twelve huntsmen.’ The lion continued: ‘You are mistaken,
they are twelve girls.’ The king said: ‘That cannot be true! How
will you prove that to me?’ ‘Oh, just let some peas be strewn in the
ante-chamber,’ answered the lion, ‘and then you will soon see. Men have
a firm step, and when they walk over peas none of them stir, but girls
trip and skip, and drag their feet, and the peas roll about.’ The king
was well pleased with the counsel, and caused the peas to be strewn.

There was, however, a servant of the king’s who favoured the huntsmen,
and when he heard that they were going to be put to this test he went to
them and repeated everything, and said: ‘The lion wants to make the king
believe that you are girls.’ Then the king’s daughter thanked him, and
said to her maidens: ‘Show some strength, and step firmly on the peas.’
So next morning when the king had the twelve huntsmen called before
him, and they came into the ante-chamber where the peas were lying, they
stepped so firmly on them, and had such a strong, sure walk, that not
one of the peas either rolled or stirred. Then they went away again,
and the king said to the lion: ‘You have lied to me, they walk just like
men.’ The lion said: ‘They have been informed that they were going to
be put to the test, and have assumed some strength. Just let twelve
spinning-wheels be brought into the ante-chamber, and they will go to
them and be pleased with them, and that is what no man would do.’
The king liked the advice, and had the spinning-wheels placed in the
ante-chamber.

But the servant, who was well disposed to the huntsmen, went to them,
and disclosed the project. So when they were alone the king’s daughter
said to her eleven girls: ‘Show some constraint, and do not look round
at the spinning-wheels.’ And next morning when the king had his twelve
huntsmen summoned, they went through the ante-chamber, and never once
looked at the spinning-wheels. Then the king again said to the lion:
‘You have deceived me, they are men, for they have not looked at the
spinning-wheels.’ The lion replied: ‘They have restrained themselves.’
The king, however, would no longer believe the lion.

The twelve huntsmen always followed the king to the chase, and his
liking for them continually increased. Now it came to pass that
once when they were out hunting, news came that the king’s bride was
approaching. When the true bride heard that, it hurt her so much that
her heart was almost broken, and she fell fainting to the ground. The
king thought something had happened to his dear huntsman, ran up to him,
wanted to help him, and drew his glove off. Then he saw the ring which
he had given to his first bride, and when he looked in her face he
recognized her. Then his heart was so touched that he kissed her, and
when she opened her eyes he said: ‘You are mine, and I am yours, and
no one in the world can alter that.’ He sent a messenger to the other
bride, and entreated her to return to her own kingdom, for he had a wife
already, and someone who had just found an old key did not require a new
one. Thereupon the wedding was celebrated, and the lion was again taken
into favour, because, after all, he had told the truth.",1080,Dvanajst_lovcev,"Bil je nekoč kraljevič, ki se je mudil pri svoji nevesti, ki jo je imel močno rad. Ko je sedel tako pri nji in bil dobre volje, pa je prišlo poročilo, da mu je oče na smrt obolel in da ga želi videti pred smrtjo. Kraljevič je dejal svoji ljubljenki: »Kličejo me in zapustiti te moram. Vzemi tu prstan v spomin name. Ko bom kralj, pridem in te popeljem na svoj dom.« Odjezdil je. Ko je prišel k očetu, je bil ta res na smrt bolan in blizu smrti. »Ljubi moj sin,« mu je rekel, »hotel sem te še enkrat videti pred smrtjo. Obljubi mi, da se boš oženil po moji volji.« Imenoval mu je neko kraljično, s katero se še poznala nista, ki naj bi mu postala žena. Sin pa je bil tako zmeden in potrt, da ni nič pomislil in dejal: »Naj se zgodi, dragi oče, kakor želite.« Nato je kralj zaprl oči in umrl. Ko so oklicali sina za kralja in je minil čas žalovanja, je moral izpolniti obljubo, dano očetu, ter je dal zasnubiti kraljično. Obljubili so mu jo. To pa je zvedela njegova prva nevesta in ta nezvestoba jo je tako strašno razžalostila, da je skoraj umrla od žalosti. To videč ji je oče dejal: »Zakaj si tako žalostna, ljuba hčerka moja? Saj ti dam vse, karkoli si poželiš.« Kraljična je za trenutek pomišljala, nato pa je rekla: »Dragi oče, želim si enajst deklet, ki mi bojo po licu, po postavi in po rasti na las podobne.« 

»Naj se ti izpolni želja, če je mogoče,« je odgovoril kralj. In dal je po vsem kraljestvu tako dolgo iskati, da so našli enajst devic, ki so bile njegovi hčeri po licu, po postavi in po rasti na las podobne. Ko so prišle h kraljični, je ukazala napraviti enajst lovskih oblek, čisto enakih. In dekleta so morala obleči lovske obleke in sama je oblekla dvanajsto. Nato se je poslovila od očeta. Odjahala je s svojim spremstvom in prijahala na dvor svojega prejšnjega ženina, ki ga je tako močno ljubila. Vprašala ga je, ali potrebuje kaj lovcev in ali ne bi kar vseh skupaj sprejel v svojo službo. Mladi kralj si jo je ogledal, a je ni spoznal. Ker pa so bili vsi tako zali ljudje, je pristal, češ da jih rad sprejme. Tako je vseh dvanajst prišlo v kraljevo službo. Kralj pa je imel leva, ki je bil kaj prečudna žival. Znano mu je bilo vse, kar je bilo skritega in tajnega. Zgodilo se je, da je nekega dne lev dejal kralju: »Kralj misli, da ima dvanajst lovcev na dvoru?« »Tako je,« je rekel kralj, »dvanajst lovcev je.« Lev pa je nadaljeval: »Kralj se hudo moti, to je dvanajst deklet.« »Ta je pa bosa,« je vzkliknil kralj, »kako mi moreš dokazati to?« »Kralj naj da posuti svojo predsobo z grahom, pa se bo pr&ej prepričal,« je rekel lev. »Moški imajo čvrst korak in če stopijo na grah, se grašek niti ne zgane, dekleta pa ca-pljajo in plesaje podrsavajo, grah pod nogami pa se začne kotaliti.« Kralju je bil ta nasvet kar všeč in je dal svojo predsobo posuti z grahom. Kralj pa je imel nekega služabnika, ki je bil lovcem naklonjen. Ko je slišal, kakšen poskus bojo napravili z njimi, 

je prišel k njim in jim vse povedal: »Lev hoče natveziti kralju, da ste vsi sama dekleta.« Lepo se mu je zahvalila kraljična, nato pa rekla svojini družicam: »Potrudite se malo in stopajte krepko po grahu.« Ko je dal kralj drugo jutro poklicati lovce k sebi in so te prišle v predsobo, kjer je bil posut grah, so tako krepko stopale po njem in imele tako trden in močan korak, da se niti grašek ni zakotalil ali premaknil. Po njihovem odhodu je rekel kralj levu: »Nalagal si me, saj stopajo kot moški.« »Zvedele so, da jih bo kralj preskušal,« je rekel lev. »Potrudile so se. Kralj naj da postaviti dvanajst kolovratov v predsobo. Ko pridejo, se bojo vse veselo ozrle po njih. In tega moški ne stori.« Kralju je bil nasvet všeč in je dal postaviti kolovrate v predsobo. Služabnik pa, ki je bil za lovce, je šel in razkril kraljevo namero. Kraljična je dejala svojim dekletom, ko so bile same: »Potrudite se malo in se nikar ne ozirajte po kolovratih.« Ko je dal kralj naslednje jutro poklicati svojih dvanajst lovcev, so prišle v predsobo in niti z očesom ni nobena trenila proti kolovratom. Ves jezen je rekel kralj levu: »Spet si me nalagal, to so moški, ker se niti ozrli niso po kolovratih.« »Zvedele so, da jih kralj preskuša,« je odgovoril lev. »Zato so se prisilile.« Kralj pa levu ni več verjel. Dvanajsterica lovcev je kralja stalno spremljala na lovu. Kralj jih je imel vedno rajši. Zgodilo se je, da so bili nekoč na lovu, ko je prišla vest, da prihaja kraljeva nevesta. 

Ko je prva nevesta to slišala, jo je tako silno zabolelo srce, da ji je skoraj počilo. Omedlela je in se zgrudila na tla. Kralj je menil, da se je njegovemu dragemu lovcu kaj pripetilo, skočil je k njemu in mu hotel pomagati ter mu slekel rokavico. Tedaj pa je zapazil prstan, ki ga je bil dal svoji prvi nevesti. In ko jo je pogledal v obraz, jo je spoznal. Bil je tako presunjen, da jo je poljubil. Ko pa je odprla oči, je ginjeno dejal: »Ti si moja in jaz sem tvoj in tega nobena sila in obljuba ne more spremeniti.« Poslal je sla k drugi nevesti in jo prosil, naj se vrne v svojo deželo, ker že ima svojo ljubljeno soprogo in da stara ljubezen nikdar ne zarjavi. Potlej pa so slavili poroko in lev je prišel spet v milost, ker je bil vendarle tisti, ki je govoril resnico.

12,DOCTOR KNOWALL,"There was once upon a time a poor peasant called Crabb, who drove with
two oxen a load of wood to the town, and sold it to a doctor for two
talers. When the money was being counted out to him, it so happened that
the doctor was sitting at table, and when the peasant saw how well he
ate and drank, his heart desired what he saw, and would willingly
have been a doctor too. So he remained standing a while, and at length
inquired if he too could not be a doctor. ‘Oh, yes,’ said the doctor,
‘that is soon managed.’ ‘What must I do?’ asked the peasant. ‘In the
first place buy yourself an A B C book of the kind which has a cock on
the frontispiece; in the second, turn your cart and your two oxen into
money, and get yourself some clothes, and whatsoever else pertains to
medicine; thirdly, have a sign painted for yourself with the words: “I
am Doctor Knowall,” and have that nailed up above your house-door.’ The
peasant did everything that he had been told to do. When he had doctored
people awhile, but not long, a rich and great lord had some money
stolen. Then he was told about Doctor Knowall who lived in such and such
a village, and must know what had become of the money. So the lord had
the horses harnessed to his carriage, drove out to the village, and
asked Crabb if he were Doctor Knowall. Yes, he was, he said. Then he was
to go with him and bring back the stolen money. ‘Oh, yes, but Grete, my
wife, must go too.’ The lord was willing, and let both of them have a
seat in the carriage, and they all drove away together. When they came
to the nobleman’s castle, the table was spread, and Crabb was told to
sit down and eat. ‘Yes, but my wife, Grete, too,’ said he, and he seated
himself with her at the table. And when the first servant came with a
dish of delicate fare, the peasant nudged his wife, and said: ‘Grete,
that was the first,’ meaning that was the servant who brought the first
dish. The servant, however, thought he intended by that to say: ‘That is
the first thief,’ and as he actually was so, he was terrified, and said
to his comrade outside: ‘The doctor knows all: we shall fare ill, he
said I was the first.’ The second did not want to go in at all, but was
forced. So when he went in with his dish, the peasant nudged his wife,
and said: ‘Grete, that is the second.’ This servant was equally alarmed,
and he got out as fast as he could. The third fared no better, for the
peasant again said: ‘Grete, that is the third.’ The fourth had to carry
in a dish that was covered, and the lord told the doctor that he was to
show his skill, and guess what was beneath the cover. Actually, there
were crabs. The doctor looked at the dish, had no idea what to say, and
cried: ‘Ah, poor Crabb.’ When the lord heard that, he cried: ‘There! he
knows it; he must also know who has the money!’

On this the servants looked terribly uneasy, and made a sign to the
doctor that they wished him to step outside for a moment. When therefore
he went out, all four of them confessed to him that they had stolen
the money, and said that they would willingly restore it and give him a
heavy sum into the bargain, if he would not denounce them, for if he
did they would be hanged. They led him to the spot where the money was
concealed. With this the doctor was satisfied, and returned to the hall,
sat down to the table, and said: ‘My lord, now will I search in my book
where the gold is hidden.’ The fifth servant, however, crept into the
stove to hear if the doctor knew still more. But the doctor sat still
and opened his A B C book, turned the pages backwards and forwards, and
looked for the cock. As he could not find it immediately he said: ‘I
know you are there, so you had better come out!’ Then the fellow in the
stove thought that the doctor meant him, and full of terror, sprang out,
crying: ‘That man knows everything!’ Then Doctor Knowall showed the lord
where the money was, but did not say who had stolen it, and received
from both sides much money in reward, and became a renowned man.",780,Doktor_vseznalec,"Bil je nekdaj reven kmet, Rak po imenu. Nekega dne je z dvema voloma odpeljal drva v mesto in jih prodal nekemu doktorju. Doktor je ravno sedel pri kosilu, ko je prišel kmet po denar. Kmet je videl, kako doktor lepo je in pije in srce mu je prevzela želja, da bi bil tudi sam doktor. Ko je tako še malo počakal, je nazadnje vprašal, ali bi tudi on lahko postal doktor. »Zakaj pa ne?« je rekel doktor. »To se kaj kmalu lahko zgodi.« »Kaj pa moram storiti?« je vprašal kmet. »Najprej si kupi abecednik, knjigo, ki ima spredaj petelina naslikanega,« ga je doktor začel poučevati. »Drugič: prodaj voz in oba vola in si z denarjem nakupi oblek in vse drugo, kar je potrebno za doktorsko umetnost; tretjič: naroči si tablo z napisom: ,Jaz sem doktor Vseznalec', ter si jo pribij nad hišna vrata.« Kmet je storil vse, kakor mu je bilo naročeno. Ko je tako nekaj časa doktaril, toda ne preveč, se je zgodilo, da so nekemu bogatemu, visokemu gospodu ukradli denar. Ta gospod je zvedel, da živi v tej in tej vasi doktor Vseznalec, ki mora za gotovo vedeti, kam je denar izginil. Zato je dal napreči voz in se odpeljal v tisto vas ter vprašal kmeta, če je on doktor Vseznalec. »Res, to sem jaz,« je rekel krnet. »Pojdite torej z menoj in poiščite ukradeni denar!« 

»Dobro,« je rekel Vseznalec, »a Jera, moja žena, mora tudi z menoj.« Gospod je bil zadovoljen, posadil ju je na voz in vsi trije so se odpeljali. Ko so prišli v plemiški dvorec, je bila miza že pogrnjena in doktor Vseznalec je moral kositi z drugimi vred »Prav, a Jeta, moja žena, tudi,« je rekel in sedel za mizo. Ko je prišel prvi služabnik s skledo dobre jedi, je dregnil krnet svojo ženo in dejal: »Jera, ta je bil prvi!« — misleč pri tem tistega, ki je prinesel prvo jed. Služabnik pa je mislil, .da je hotel reči s tem: »To je bil prvi tat.« In ker je bilo to res, se je ustrašil in je zunaj rekel svojim tovarišem: »Doktor vse ve, slabo jo bomo skupili. Dejal je, da sem bil jaz prvi.« Drugi služabnik se kar ni upal noter, a moral je. Ko je vstopil s svojo skledo v sobo, je kmet dregnil svojo ženo: »Jera, ta je drugi!« Tudi ta služabnik se je hudo prestrašil in se je potrudil, da je bil čimprej zunaj. Tretjemu se ni godilo nič drugače, kajti kmet je rekel svoji ženi: »Jera, ta je tretji!« Četrti je moral prinesti v sobo pokrito skledo in gospod je rekel doktorju, da bi preskusil njegovo umetnost, naj ugane, kaj je v skledi. V njej so bili raki. Kmet je ogledoval skledo in ni vedel, kako bi si pomagal, zato je zamrmral: »Oh, jaz ubogi Rak!« Ko je gospod to slišal, je kriknil: »Glejte ga, res ve, gotovo tudi ve, kdo ima denar.« Služabnik je kar prebledel od groze in je pomežiknil doktorju, naj stopi malo ven. Zunaj so mu vsi štirje priznali, da so ukradli denar, in obljubili, da ga bojo vrnili in mu dali še lepo nagrado povrhu, če jih ne izda, ker bi jim drugače trda predla. Pokazali so mu tudi, kje je denar skrit. 

Doktor je bil zadovoljen s tem, vrnil se je v sobo, sedel za mizo in rekel: »Gospod, zdaj naj še poiščem v tej moji knjigi, kje tiči denar.« Peti služabnik pa se je medtem splazil v peč, da bi slišal, ali ve doktor še kaj več. Ta pa je sedel, odprl svoj abecednik in listal po njem, da bi poiskal petelina. Ko ga pa ni mogel najti, je rekel jezno: »Saj si notri, zato moraš tudi ven.« Tisti v peči pa je mislil, da leti to nanj in je ves prestrašen skočil iz peči ter dejal: »Ta človek vse ve.« Nato je doktor Vseznalec pokazal gospodu, kje je denar, ni pa povedal, kdo ga je ukradel. In tako je od njega in od njih dobil veliko denarja za nagrado in postal nadvse imeniten.

13,THE STORY OF THE YOUTH WHO WENT FORTH TO LEARN WHAT FEAR WAS,"A certain father had two sons, the elder of who was smart and sensible,
and could do everything, but the younger was stupid and could neither
learn nor understand anything, and when people saw him they said:
‘There’s a fellow who will give his father some trouble!’ When anything
had to be done, it was always the elder who was forced to do it; but
if his father bade him fetch anything when it was late, or in the
night-time, and the way led through the churchyard, or any other dismal
place, he answered: ‘Oh, no father, I’ll not go there, it makes me
shudder!’ for he was afraid. Or when stories were told by the fire at
night which made the flesh creep, the listeners sometimes said: ‘Oh,
it makes us shudder!’ The younger sat in a corner and listened with
the rest of them, and could not imagine what they could mean. ‘They are
always saying: “It makes me shudder, it makes me shudder!” It does not
make me shudder,’ thought he. ‘That, too, must be an art of which I
understand nothing!’

Now it came to pass that his father said to him one day: ‘Hearken to me,
you fellow in the corner there, you are growing tall and strong, and you
too must learn something by which you can earn your bread. Look how your
brother works, but you do not even earn your salt.’ ‘Well, father,’ he
replied, ‘I am quite willing to learn something--indeed, if it could but
be managed, I should like to learn how to shudder. I don’t understand
that at all yet.’ The elder brother smiled when he heard that, and
thought to himself: ‘Goodness, what a blockhead that brother of mine is!
He will never be good for anything as long as he lives! He who wants to
be a sickle must bend himself betimes.’

The father sighed, and answered him: ‘You shall soon learn what it is to
shudder, but you will not earn your bread by that.’

Soon after this the sexton came to the house on a visit, and the father
bewailed his trouble, and told him how his younger son was so backward
in every respect that he knew nothing and learnt nothing. ‘Just think,’
said he, ‘when I asked him how he was going to earn his bread, he
actually wanted to learn to shudder.’ ‘If that be all,’ replied the
sexton, ‘he can learn that with me. Send him to me, and I will soon
polish him.’ The father was glad to do it, for he thought: ‘It will
train the boy a little.’ The sexton therefore took him into his house,
and he had to ring the church bell. After a day or two, the sexton awoke
him at midnight, and bade him arise and go up into the church tower and
ring the bell. ‘You shall soon learn what shuddering is,’ thought he,
and secretly went there before him; and when the boy was at the top of
the tower and turned round, and was just going to take hold of the bell
rope, he saw a white figure standing on the stairs opposite the sounding
hole. ‘Who is there?’ cried he, but the figure made no reply, and did
not move or stir. ‘Give an answer,’ cried the boy, ‘or take yourself
off, you have no business here at night.’

The sexton, however, remained standing motionless that the boy might
think he was a ghost. The boy cried a second time: ‘What do you want
here?--speak if you are an honest fellow, or I will throw you down the
steps!’ The sexton thought: ‘He can’t mean to be as bad as his words,’
uttered no sound and stood as if he were made of stone. Then the boy
called to him for the third time, and as that was also to no purpose,
he ran against him and pushed the ghost down the stairs, so that it fell
down the ten steps and remained lying there in a corner. Thereupon he
rang the bell, went home, and without saying a word went to bed, and
fell asleep. The sexton’s wife waited a long time for her husband, but
he did not come back. At length she became uneasy, and wakened the boy,
and asked: ‘Do you know where my husband is? He climbed up the tower
before you did.’ ‘No, I don’t know,’ replied the boy, ‘but someone was
standing by the sounding hole on the other side of the steps, and as he
would neither give an answer nor go away, I took him for a scoundrel,
and threw him downstairs. Just go there and you will see if it was he.
I should be sorry if it were.’ The woman ran away and found her husband,
who was lying moaning in the corner, and had broken his leg.

She carried him down, and then with loud screams she hastened to the
boy’s father, ‘Your boy,’ cried she, ‘has been the cause of a great
misfortune! He has thrown my husband down the steps so that he broke his
leg. Take the good-for-nothing fellow out of our house.’ The father was
terrified, and ran thither and scolded the boy. ‘What wicked tricks
are these?’ said he. ‘The devil must have put them into your head.’
‘Father,’ he replied, ‘do listen to me. I am quite innocent. He was
standing there by night like one intent on doing evil. I did not know
who it was, and I entreated him three times either to speak or to go
away.’ ‘Ah,’ said the father, ‘I have nothing but unhappiness with you.
Go out of my sight. I will see you no more.’

‘Yes, father, right willingly, wait only until it is day. Then will I
go forth and learn how to shudder, and then I shall, at any rate,
understand one art which will support me.’ ‘Learn what you will,’ spoke
the father, ‘it is all the same to me. Here are fifty talers for you.
Take these and go into the wide world, and tell no one from whence you
come, and who is your father, for I have reason to be ashamed of you.’
‘Yes, father, it shall be as you will. If you desire nothing more than
that, I can easily keep it in mind.’

When the day dawned, therefore, the boy put his fifty talers into his
pocket, and went forth on the great highway, and continually said to
himself: ‘If I could but shudder! If I could but shudder!’ Then a man
approached who heard this conversation which the youth was holding with
himself, and when they had walked a little farther to where they could
see the gallows, the man said to him: ‘Look, there is the tree where
seven men have married the ropemaker’s daughter, and are now learning
how to fly. Sit down beneath it, and wait till night comes, and you will
soon learn how to shudder.’ ‘If that is all that is wanted,’ answered
the youth, ‘it is easily done; but if I learn how to shudder as fast as
that, you shall have my fifty talers. Just come back to me early in the
morning.’ Then the youth went to the gallows, sat down beneath it, and
waited till evening came. And as he was cold, he lighted himself a fire,
but at midnight the wind blew so sharply that in spite of his fire, he
could not get warm. And as the wind knocked the hanged men against each
other, and they moved backwards and forwards, he thought to himself:
‘If you shiver below by the fire, how those up above must freeze and
suffer!’ And as he felt pity for them, he raised the ladder, and climbed
up, unbound one of them after the other, and brought down all seven.
Then he stoked the fire, blew it, and set them all round it to warm
themselves. But they sat there and did not stir, and the fire caught
their clothes. So he said: ‘Take care, or I will hang you up again.’ The
dead men, however, did not hear, but were quite silent, and let their
rags go on burning. At this he grew angry, and said: ‘If you will not
take care, I cannot help you, I will not be burnt with you,’ and he hung
them up again each in his turn. Then he sat down by his fire and fell
asleep, and the next morning the man came to him and wanted to have
the fifty talers, and said: ‘Well do you know how to shudder?’ ‘No,’
answered he, ‘how should I know? Those fellows up there did not open
their mouths, and were so stupid that they let the few old rags which
they had on their bodies get burnt.’ Then the man saw that he would not
get the fifty talers that day, and went away saying: ‘Such a youth has
never come my way before.’

The youth likewise went his way, and once more began to mutter to
himself: ‘Ah, if I could but shudder! Ah, if I could but shudder!’ A
waggoner who was striding behind him heard this and asked: ‘Who are
you?’ ‘I don’t know,’ answered the youth. Then the waggoner asked: ‘From
whence do you come?’ ‘I know not.’ ‘Who is your father?’ ‘That I may
not tell you.’ ‘What is it that you are always muttering between your
teeth?’ ‘Ah,’ replied the youth, ‘I do so wish I could shudder, but
no one can teach me how.’ ‘Enough of your foolish chatter,’ said the
waggoner. ‘Come, go with me, I will see about a place for you.’ The
youth went with the waggoner, and in the evening they arrived at an inn
where they wished to pass the night. Then at the entrance of the parlour
the youth again said quite loudly: ‘If I could but shudder! If I could
but shudder!’ The host who heard this, laughed and said: ‘If that is
your desire, there ought to be a good opportunity for you here.’ ‘Ah,
be silent,’ said the hostess, ‘so many prying persons have already lost
their lives, it would be a pity and a shame if such beautiful eyes as
these should never see the daylight again.’

But the youth said: ‘However difficult it may be, I will learn it. For
this purpose indeed have I journeyed forth.’ He let the host have
no rest, until the latter told him, that not far from thence stood a
haunted castle where anyone could very easily learn what shuddering was,
if he would but watch in it for three nights. The king had promised that
he who would venture should have his daughter to wife, and she was the
most beautiful maiden the sun shone on. Likewise in the castle lay great
treasures, which were guarded by evil spirits, and these treasures would
then be freed, and would make a poor man rich enough. Already many men
had gone into the castle, but as yet none had come out again. Then the
youth went next morning to the king, and said: ‘If it be allowed, I will
willingly watch three nights in the haunted castle.’

The king looked at him, and as the youth pleased him, he said: ‘You may
ask for three things to take into the castle with you, but they must
be things without life.’ Then he answered: ‘Then I ask for a fire, a
turning lathe, and a cutting-board with the knife.’

The king had these things carried into the castle for him during the
day. When night was drawing near, the youth went up and made himself
a bright fire in one of the rooms, placed the cutting-board and knife
beside it, and seated himself by the turning-lathe. ‘Ah, if I could
but shudder!’ said he, ‘but I shall not learn it here either.’ Towards
midnight he was about to poke his fire, and as he was blowing it,
something cried suddenly from one corner: ‘Au, miau! how cold we are!’
‘You fools!’ cried he, ‘what are you crying about? If you are cold, come
and take a seat by the fire and warm yourselves.’ And when he had said
that, two great black cats came with one tremendous leap and sat down
on each side of him, and looked savagely at him with their fiery
eyes. After a short time, when they had warmed themselves, they said:
‘Comrade, shall we have a game of cards?’ ‘Why not?’ he replied, ‘but
just show me your paws.’ Then they stretched out their claws. ‘Oh,’ said
he, ‘what long nails you have! Wait, I must first cut them for you.’
Thereupon he seized them by the throats, put them on the cutting-board
and screwed their feet fast. ‘I have looked at your fingers,’ said he,
‘and my fancy for card-playing has gone,’ and he struck them dead and
threw them out into the water. But when he had made away with these two,
and was about to sit down again by his fire, out from every hole and
corner came black cats and black dogs with red-hot chains, and more
and more of them came until he could no longer move, and they yelled
horribly, and got on his fire, pulled it to pieces, and tried to put
it out. He watched them for a while quietly, but at last when they were
going too far, he seized his cutting-knife, and cried: ‘Away with you,
vermin,’ and began to cut them down. Some of them ran away, the others
he killed, and threw out into the fish-pond. When he came back he fanned
the embers of his fire again and warmed himself. And as he thus sat, his
eyes would keep open no longer, and he felt a desire to sleep. Then he
looked round and saw a great bed in the corner. ‘That is the very thing
for me,’ said he, and got into it. When he was just going to shut his
eyes, however, the bed began to move of its own accord, and went over
the whole of the castle. ‘That’s right,’ said he, ‘but go faster.’ Then
the bed rolled on as if six horses were harnessed to it, up and down,
over thresholds and stairs, but suddenly hop, hop, it turned over upside
down, and lay on him like a mountain. But he threw quilts and pillows up
in the air, got out and said: ‘Now anyone who likes, may drive,’ and
lay down by his fire, and slept till it was day. In the morning the king
came, and when he saw him lying there on the ground, he thought the evil
spirits had killed him and he was dead. Then said he: ‘After all it is a
pity,--for so handsome a man.’ The youth heard it, got up, and said: ‘It
has not come to that yet.’ Then the king was astonished, but very glad,
and asked how he had fared. ‘Very well indeed,’ answered he; ‘one
night is past, the two others will pass likewise.’ Then he went to the
innkeeper, who opened his eyes very wide, and said: ‘I never expected to
see you alive again! Have you learnt how to shudder yet?’ ‘No,’ said he,
‘it is all in vain. If someone would but tell me!’

The second night he again went up into the old castle, sat down by the
fire, and once more began his old song: ‘If I could but shudder!’ When
midnight came, an uproar and noise of tumbling about was heard; at
first it was low, but it grew louder and louder. Then it was quiet for
a while, and at length with a loud scream, half a man came down the
chimney and fell before him. ‘Hullo!’ cried he, ‘another half belongs
to this. This is not enough!’ Then the uproar began again, there was a
roaring and howling, and the other half fell down likewise. ‘Wait,’ said
he, ‘I will just stoke up the fire a little for you.’ When he had done
that and looked round again, the two pieces were joined together, and a
hideous man was sitting in his place. ‘That is no part of our bargain,’
said the youth, ‘the bench is mine.’ The man wanted to push him away;
the youth, however, would not allow that, but thrust him off with all
his strength, and seated himself again in his own place. Then still more
men fell down, one after the other; they brought nine dead men’s legs
and two skulls, and set them up and played at nine-pins with them. The
youth also wanted to play and said: ‘Listen you, can I join you?’ ‘Yes,
if you have any money.’ ‘Money enough,’ replied he, ‘but your balls are
not quite round.’ Then he took the skulls and put them in the lathe and
turned them till they were round. ‘There, now they will roll better!’
said he. ‘Hurrah! now we’ll have fun!’ He played with them and lost some
of his money, but when it struck twelve, everything vanished from his
sight. He lay down and quietly fell asleep. Next morning the king came
to inquire after him. ‘How has it fared with you this time?’ asked he.
‘I have been playing at nine-pins,’ he answered, ‘and have lost a couple
of farthings.’ ‘Have you not shuddered then?’ ‘What?’ said he, ‘I have
had a wonderful time! If I did but know what it was to shudder!’

The third night he sat down again on his bench and said quite sadly:
‘If I could but shudder.’ When it grew late, six tall men came in and
brought a coffin. Then he said: ‘Ha, ha, that is certainly my little
cousin, who died only a few days ago,’ and he beckoned with his finger,
and cried: ‘Come, little cousin, come.’ They placed the coffin on the
ground, but he went to it and took the lid off, and a dead man lay
therein. He felt his face, but it was cold as ice. ‘Wait,’ said he, ‘I
will warm you a little,’ and went to the fire and warmed his hand and
laid it on the dead man’s face, but he remained cold. Then he took him
out, and sat down by the fire and laid him on his breast and rubbed his
arms that the blood might circulate again. As this also did no good, he
thought to himself: ‘When two people lie in bed together, they warm each
other,’ and carried him to the bed, covered him over and lay down by
him. After a short time the dead man became warm too, and began to move.
Then said the youth, ‘See, little cousin, have I not warmed you?’ The
dead man, however, got up and cried: ‘Now will I strangle you.’

‘What!’ said he, ‘is that the way you thank me? You shall at once go
into your coffin again,’ and he took him up, threw him into it, and shut
the lid. Then came the six men and carried him away again. ‘I cannot
manage to shudder,’ said he. ‘I shall never learn it here as long as I
live.’

Then a man entered who was taller than all others, and looked terrible.
He was old, however, and had a long white beard. ‘You wretch,’ cried he,
‘you shall soon learn what it is to shudder, for you shall die.’ ‘Not so
fast,’ replied the youth. ‘If I am to die, I shall have to have a say
in it.’ ‘I will soon seize you,’ said the fiend. ‘Softly, softly, do not
talk so big. I am as strong as you are, and perhaps even stronger.’
‘We shall see,’ said the old man. ‘If you are stronger, I will let you
go--come, we will try.’ Then he led him by dark passages to a smith’s
forge, took an axe, and with one blow struck an anvil into the ground.
‘I can do better than that,’ said the youth, and went to the other
anvil. The old man placed himself near and wanted to look on, and his
white beard hung down. Then the youth seized the axe, split the anvil
with one blow, and in it caught the old man’s beard. ‘Now I have you,’
said the youth. ‘Now it is your turn to die.’ Then he seized an iron bar
and beat the old man till he moaned and entreated him to stop, when he
would give him great riches. The youth drew out the axe and let him go.
The old man led him back into the castle, and in a cellar showed him
three chests full of gold. ‘Of these,’ said he, ‘one part is for the
poor, the other for the king, the third yours.’ In the meantime it
struck twelve, and the spirit disappeared, so that the youth stood in
darkness. ‘I shall still be able to find my way out,’ said he, and felt
about, found the way into the room, and slept there by his fire.
Next morning the king came and said: ‘Now you must have learnt what
shuddering is?’ ‘No,’ he answered; ‘what can it be? My dead cousin was
here, and a bearded man came and showed me a great deal of money down
below, but no one told me what it was to shudder.’ ‘Then,’ said the
king, ‘you have saved the castle, and shall marry my daughter.’ ‘That
is all very well,’ said he, ‘but still I do not know what it is to
shudder!’

Then the gold was brought up and the wedding celebrated; but howsoever
much the young king loved his wife, and however happy he was, he still
said always: ‘If I could but shudder--if I could but shudder.’ And this
at last angered her. Her waiting-maid said: ‘I will find a cure for him;
he shall soon learn what it is to shudder.’ She went out to the stream
which flowed through the garden, and had a whole bucketful of gudgeons
brought to her. At night when the young king was sleeping, his wife was
to draw the clothes off him and empty the bucket full of cold water
with the gudgeons in it over him, so that the little fishes would
sprawl about him. Then he woke up and cried: ‘Oh, what makes me shudder
so?--what makes me shudder so, dear wife? Ah! now I know what it is to
shudder!’",3815,Zgodba_o_cloveku_ki_je_sel_po_svetu_da_bi_strah_spoznal,"Bil je oče, ki je imel dva sinova: starejši je bil pameten in prebrisan ter se je povsod znašel, mlajši pa je bil neumen, ničesar ni razumel in se ni ničesar naučil. In ko so ga ljudje videli, so crovorili: »S tem bo imel oče še velike križe in težave!« Kadar je bilo treba kaj storiti, je moral to vselej napraviti starejši. Če pa ga je oče pozno zvečer ali celo ponoči kam poslal in je pot držala čez pokopališče ali pa v kak drug grozljiv kraj, je navadno odgovoril: »Ne, oče, tja pa ne grem. Strah me je.« Bal se je. Ali pa so si zvečer pri ognju pripovedovali zgodbe, pri katerih obliva človeka kurja polt. Tedaj je marsikateri poslušalec vzkliknil: »Ah, kar zona me obliva!« Mlajši sin je sedel v kotu, poslušal in ni mogel razumeti, kaj to pomeni. »Zmerom govorijo: Strah me je! Zona me obliva! Mene pa ni strah in me nič ne obliva; gotovo je to kakšna umetnija, o kateri prav nič ne vem.« Pa mu je oče nekega dne dejal: »Slišiš, ti tam v kotu, velik si že in močan. Moral se boš česa naučiti, s čimer si boš služil vsakdanji kruh. Saj vidiš brata, kako se trudi, pri tebi pa je vse bob ob steno.« »Ej, oče,« je odgovoril, »saj bi se rad kaj naučil. Če bi bilo mogoče, bi se rad naučil, kaj je to strah. Nikakor ne morem in ne morem razumeti tega.« Ko je starejši sin to slišal, se je zasmejal in pomislil: »Križana gora, kakšna prismoda je ta moj brat! Živ dan ne bo nič prida iz njega. Drevo je treba iipogniti, ko je še mlado.« 

Oče je zavzdihnil in mu odgovoril: »Kaj je strah, se boš že še naučil, a kruha si ne boš služil s tem.« Malo zatem je prišel k očetu vaški cerkovnik na obisk. Oče mu je potožil, kako njegov mlajši sin ni za nobeno rabo, da ničesar ne ve in se ničesar ne uči. »Pomislite! Ko sem ga vprašal, s čim si bo služil kruh,  , mi je celo rekel, da bi se rad naučil, kaj je to strah.« »No, če je samo to,« je dejal mežnar, »se tega lahko pri meni nauči. Pošljite ga k meni, jaz mu že vtepem strah v glavo.« Oče je bil zadovoljen s tem, ker je mislil, da pride fant malo k pameti. Cerkovnik ga je torej vzel k sebi, da bi mu zvonil. Čez nekaj dni ga je zbudil opolnoči, mu velel vstati, iti v zvonik in zvoniti. »Jaz te že naučim, da boš spoznal, kaj je strah,« je pomislil cerkovnik in skrivaj odšel pred njim v zvonik. Ko je bil fant zgoraj in se obrnil ter hotel prijeti za vrv, je videl, da stoji na stopnicah nasproti lini neka bela prikazen. »Kdo je tam?« je zavpil. Postava pa ni dala glasu od sebe, ni se premaknila, ni se zganila. »Odgovori!« je zavpil fant. »Ali pa glej, da izgineš! Ponoči nimaš kaj početi tukaj!« Cerkovnik pa se ni ganil, tako da bi fant mislil, da je prikazen. Fant je drugič zavpil: »Kaj iščeš tukaj? Govori, če si pošten človek, ali pa te vržem po stopnicah.« Cerkovnik pa si ni mislil, da bi bilo res lahko kaj hudega. Ni dal glasu od sebe in je stal tam, kakor bi bil iz kamna. Nato je fant še tretjič zaklical in ko je bilo tudi to zaman, se je zaletel in pahnil prikazen po stopnicah, da se je skotalila deset stopnic in obležala v kotu. Ko je odzvonil, je odšel domov in ne da bi komu kaj rekel, legel v posteljo in zaspal. Cerkovnica je dolgo čakala svojega moža, a ko ga ni in ni bilo, jo je prevzel strah. Zbudila je fanta in vprašala: 

»Ali veš, kje je ostal moj mož? Odšel je pred teboj v zvonik.« »Ne vem,« je odgovoril fant. »A nekdo je stal na stopnicah nasproti lini in ker mi ni dal odgovora in ni maral oditi, sem ga imel za malopridneža in sem ga pahnil po stopnicah. Pojdite tja in poglejte, kdo je bil. Hudo mi je, če je bil.« Žena je odhitela in našla svojega moža, ki je ležal v kotu in stokal z zlomljeno nogo. Odnesla ga je domov in pohitela z glasnim jokom k fantovemu očetu: »Vaš fant,« je zacvilila, »je povzročil hudo nesrečo. Vrgel je mojega moža po stopnicah, da si je zlomil nogo. Spravite nam tega ničvredneža iz hiše!« Oče se je ustrašil, stekel tja in ozmerjal sina: 
»Kakšne hudobne neumnosti pa so to? Tega te je sam hudobec naučil!« »Poslušaj, oče,« je odgovoril sin, »jaz sem čisto nedolžen. Stal je tam ponoči kakor bi kaj hudega kuhal. Saj nisem vedel, kdo je, trikrat sem ga opomnil, naj spregovori ali pa odide.« »Oh,« je rekel oče, »same nadloge imam s teboj. Pojdi mi izpred oči, ne maram te več videti!« »Prav rad, oče, počakaj samo, da se zdani. Grem, da bi se naučil, kaj je strah. Tako bom vsaj znal eno umetnijo, s katero se bom preživljal.« »Uči se, kar se hočeš,« je rekel oče, »meni je vseeno. Na petdeset tolarjev, pojdi s tem v daljni svet, a živi duši ne črhni, od kod si in kdo je tvoj oče, ker me mora biti sram zate.« »Prav, oče, kakor želiš. Če nič drugega ne zahtevaš, to si bom že lahko zapomnil.« Ko se je zdanilo, je fant vtaknil svojih petdeset tolarjev v žep in se odpravil na široko deželno cesto. Tako gredoč je govoril sam pri sebi: »Ko bi le zvedel, kaj je strah! Ko bi me le bilo strah!« 

Pa ga je dohitel človek, ki je slišal, kaj govori fant sam pri sebi. In ko sta hodila kos poti skupaj ter zagledala vislice pred seboj, mu je človek dejal: »Vidiš tistole drevo tam? Sedem jih visi na njem. Oženili so se z vrvarjevo hčerjo in se učijo letanja. Sedi podnje in počakaj, da bo noč, pa se boš že naučil, kaj je strah.« »Če ni treba nič drugega,« je menil fant, »je to prav lahko. Če bom res tako hitro spoznal strah, ti dam mojih petdeset tolarjev. Kar vrni se jutri zjutraj.« Nato je šel fant k vislicam, sedel podnje in čakal, da se bo zvečerilo. In ker ga je zeblo, je zakuril ogenj. Okrog polnoči je zapihal tak mrzel veter, da se kljub ognju ni mogel ogreti. In ko je začel veter zibati obešence drugega proti drugemu, da so bingljali sem in tja, je pomislil: »Tebe zebe tukaj pri ognju, kako more zebsti šele te zgoraj, da tako brcajo.« In ker je bil mehkega srca, je pristavil lestev, odvezal drugega za drugim in jih vseh sedem odnesel na tla. Nato je podgrebel ogenj, popihal vanj in jih posadil okrog, da bi se ogreli. Oni pa so sedeli in se niso ganili in ogenj je segal po njihovi obleki. Ko je videl to, jim je rekel: »Pazite se, drugače vas obesim 
nazaj.« Mrtveci pa niso slišali, molčali so in pustili, da so se jim naprej cunje smodile. Fant se je razjezil in dejal: »Če nočete paziti, vam ne morem pomagati. Nočem zgoreti z vami,« in jih obesil nazaj. Nato je sedel k svojemu ognju in zaspal. Drugo jutro je prišel tisti človek po petdeset tolarjev in rekel: »Zdaj menda veš, kaj je strah?« »Ne, od kod pa bi vedel?« je odgovoril fant. »Tile tam gori niti ust niso odprli in bili so tako neumni, da so pustili, da so jim zgorele cunje, ki so jih imeli na sebi.« 

Tedaj je človek uvidel, da ta dan ne bo dobil petdeset tolarjev. Odšel je in rekel sam pri sebi : »Ne, na kaj takega pa še nisem naletel.« Tudi fant je šel svojo pot in spet začel govoriti sam pri sebi: »Oh, da bi me bilo strah! Ko bi me bilo strah!« To je slišal voznik, ki je stopal za njim, pa ga je vprašal: »Kdo pa si?« »Ne vem,« je rekel fant. Voznik je dalje vprašal: »Od kod si?« »Ne vem.« »Kdo je tvoj oče?« »Tega ne smem povedati.« »A kaj venomer momljaš sam pri sebi?« »Eh,« je zavzdihnil fant, »rad bi doživel, da bi me bilo strah; a nihče me ne more tega naučiti.« »Kar tiho bodi,« je dejal voznik. »Pojdi z menoj, pomagal te bom spraviti pod streho.« Fant je šel z voznikom in zvečer sta prišla do krčme, kjer naj bi prenočila. Ko sta stopila v izbo, je fant spet na ves glas dejal: »Ko bi me bilo strah! Da bi me bilo strah!« Krčmar, ki je slišal to, se je zasmejal in rekel: »če te to mika, imaš priložnosti dovolj.« »Ah, molči rajši,« se je vmešala krčmarica. »Že marsikateri predrznež je plačal s svojim življenjem; bila bi velika škoda za te lepe oči, če naj ne bi več gledale belega dne.« Fant pa je dejal: »Pa če bi bilo kaj :1;e- tako hudega, spoznati hočem strah, saj sem zato tudi šel na pot.« In ni odnehal, dokler mu ni krčmar povedal, da nedaleč stran stoji zakleti grad, v katerem bo lahko spoznal, kaj je strah, če le hoče tri noči prebedeti v njem. Tistemu, ki bi se mu to posrečilo, je kralj obljubil svojo hčerko za ženo, to pa je najlepša deklica pod soncem. V gradu so skriti tudi veliki 

zakladi, ki jih stražijo hudi duhovi. Bili bi osvobojeni in reven človek bi pošteno obogatel z njimi. A že mnogo jih je odšlo v ta grad, nihče pa še ni prišel ven. Naslednji dan je fant odšel h kralju in mu rekel: »Če mi dovolite, bi rad tri noči stražil v začaranem gradu.« Kralj se je ozrl vanj in ker mu je bil mladenič všeč, je dejal: »Lahko si izbereš tri stvari, seveda ne smejo biti žive, ki jih smeš vzeti s seboj.« »Potem prosim za ogenj, stružnico in rezbarski stol z nožem,« je odgovoril fant. Kralj je ukazal, da so mu vse to še podnevi odnesli v grad. Ko pa se je približala noč, je fant odšel tja in zakuril velik ogenj v izbi, zraven postavil rezbarski stol z nožem in sedel na stružnico. »Ah, ko bi me vsaj bilo strah!« in zavzdihnil. »Ampak tega tudi tukaj ne bom spoznal.« Proti polnoči je hotel ogenj malo podkuriti. Ko je tako pihal vanj, je od nekod iz kota zaslišal neko vreščanje: »Av, mijav, kako je mraz!« »Prismode neumne,« je zaklical fant, »kaj pa se derete? Če vas zebe, pridite, sedite k ognju in se ogrejte.« In komaj je spregovoril, sta z velikanskim skokom priskočili dve veliki črni mački, ki sta sedli vsaka na eno stran in ga divje gledali s svojimi ognjenimi očmi. Ko sta se malo ogreli, sta dejali: »Prijatelj, ne bi vrgli partijo kar t?« »Zakaj pa ne?« je odgovoril on. »Samo svoje tace mi malo pokažita.« Iztegnili sta svoje kremplje. »Oho,« je rekel, »kakšne dolge nohte imata, porezati vama jih moram.« S tem ju je zgrabil za vrat, ju dvignil na rezbarski stol ter jima trdo privil šape. »Po prstih sem vaju spoznal,« je dejal. »Zato me je minilo veselje za karte.« Ubil ju je in ju vrgel v vodo. 

Komaj pa je imel mir pred njima in je hotel spet sesti k svojemu ognju, so začele prihajati iz vseh kotov in koncev črne mačke in črni psi na razbeljenih verigah, prihajalo jih je več in več, da se jim ne bi mogel več skriti. Strahovito so tulili, teptali njegov ogenj, ga razmetavali in ga hoteli pogasiti. Za trenutek je to mirno gledal, ko pa mu je začelo presedati, je pograbil rezbarski nož in zavpil: »Zdaj pa od tod, svojat!« in začel sekati po njih. Kolikor jih ni pobegnilo, jih je pobil in jih vrgel v bajar tam zunaj. Ko se je vrnil, je znova razpihal ogenj ter se skušal ogreti. In ko je tako sedel, so se mu oči kar same zapirale in začutil je potrebo, da bi zaspal. Pogledal je okrog sebe in v kotu zagledal veliko posteljo. »To je pa imenitno,« je rekel in legel vanjo. Ko je hotel zatisniti oči, se je začela postelja sama od sebe premikati in vozil se je po vsem gradu. »Lepo, lepo,« se je zasmejal, »le še malo hitreje.« Tedaj pa je začela postelja dirjati, kakor bi bilo šestero konj vpreženih vanjo. Švignila je čez prag in po stopnicah gor in dol, naenkrat pa hop! hop! se je prevrnila in ga pokopala pod seboj, kakor gora. Fant je vrgel odeje in blazine s sebe, se zrinil ven in dejal: »Zdaj pa naj se vozi kdo drug.« Legel je k svojemu ognju in spal do belega dne. Zjutraj je prišel kralj in ko je zagledal fanta, kako leži na tleh, je pomislil, da so ga strahovi umorili in da je mrtev. Hudo mu je bilo zanj in je rekel: »Škoda lepega mladeniča.« Fant je slišal te besede, se dvignil in dejal: »Tako daleč pa še nismo.« Kralj se je nemalo začudil in ves vesel vprašal fanta, kako je bilo. »Čisto dobro,« je odgovoril fant. »Ena noč je minila, tudi drugi dve bosta.« 

Ko je prišel h krčmarju, ga je ta debelo pogledal. »Mislil sem že,« je rekel, »da te ne bom več videl živega. Si zdaj spoznal, kaj je strah?« »Nisem,« je rekel on, »vse je zaman; ko bi mi le mogel kdo to povedati.« Drugo noč je šel spet v stari grad, sedel k ognju in spet začel svojo staro pesmico: »Ko bi me vsaj bilo strah!« Ko se je bližala polnoč, je zaslišal ropot in neko razgrajanje, sprva tiho, nato pa vedno močneje. Nazadnje je s silovitim kričanjem skozi dimnik priletela polovica človeka, ki je padel predenj. »Hej ti,« je zaklical, »k temu spada še druga polovica, to je premalo!« Tedaj je spet zaropotalo, zahrumelo je in zatulilo in predenj je padla še druga polovica. »Čakaj,« je rekel, »da ti malo razpiham ogenj.« Ko je storil to in se ozrl okrog sebe, je videl, da sta se oba dela sestavila in na njegovem sedežu je sedel strašanski človek. »Tako se pa nisva zmenila,« je rekel mladenič. »Stružnica je moja.« Človek ga je hotel odriniti, fant pa se ni dal. S silo ga je potisnil proč in sedel na svoje mesto. Nato je padlo skozi dimnik še več mož, drug za drugim. S seboj so imeli devet mrtvaških kosti in dve mrtvaški lobanji. Postavili so kosti in začeli kegljati. Tudi fantu se je zahotelo in je vprašal: »Slišite, me sprejmete medse?« »Že, če imaš denar,« so rekli. »Denarja dovolj,« je odgovoril on. »A tele vaše krogle niso dovolj gladke in okrogle.« In vzel je mrtvaški lobanji, ju vtaknil v stružnico in ju gladko ostrugal. »Tako, zdaj boste bolje trkljali,« je dejal. »Hejsa, zdaj gre imenitno!« 

Igral je z njimi in izgubil nekaj denarja, ko pa je odbilo dvanajst, mu je vse izginilo izpred oči. Legel je in mirno zaspal. Drugo jutro je prišel kralj pogledat, kako in kaj. »Kako ti je bilo tokrat?« je vprašal. »Kegljal sem,« je rekel, »in izgubil nekaj vinarjev.« »Mar te ni bilo nič strah?« »Kje neki!« je rekel fant. »Zabavno je bilo. Ko bi le vedel, kaj je groza in strah!« Tretjo noč je spet sedel na stružnico in čemerno zamrrnral. »Ko bi me vsaj bilo strah!« Ko je bilo že pozno, je prišlo šest velikih mož, ki so prinesli mrtvaško krsto s seboj. »Ha ha, to je pa gotovo moj striček, ki je šele pred nekaj dnevi umr1,« je rekel, pomignil s prstom in vzkliknil: »Le bliže, striček, le bliže!« Možje so postavili krsto na tla, on pa je pristopil in dvignil pokrov: v krsti je ležal mrtev človek. Fant ga je potipal po obrazu. Bil je mrzel kakor led. »Čakaj,« je rekel, »malo te bom ogrel.« Šel je k ognju, si pogrel roke in mu jih položil na obraz. Mrlič je ostal mrzel. Vzel ga je iz krste, ga posadil k ognju, si ga vzel v naročje in mu drgnil roke, da bi kri spet začela krožiti. Ko tudi to ni pomagalo, se je domislil: »Če ležita v postelji dva skupaj, se Ogrejeta.« Odnesel ga je v posteljo, ga pokril in legel zraven njega. Čez nekaj časa se je mrtvec ogrel in se začel premikati. In fant mu je rekel: »Vidiš, striček, če te ne bi bil grel...« »Zdaj te bom zadavili« je zavpil mrtvec. »Kaj govoriš?« je rekel fant. »Je to tvoja hvaležnost? Pri priči moraš nazaj v svojo krsto.« Vzdignil ga je, ga vrgel vanjo In zaprl pokrov. Nato je prišlo onih šest mož in so odnesli rakev. 

»Kar noče in noče me biti strah,« je dejal. »Tega se živ dan ne bom naučil.« Ob teh besedah je vstopil možak, ki je bil večji od vseh drugih in grozovit na pogled. Bil pa je že star in imel je dolgo belo brado. »O, ti smet!« je zaklical. »Zdajle boš takoj zvedel, kaj je strah, kajti umreti moraš!« »Le ne tako hitro,« se je uprl fant. »Če moram umreti, moram biti tudi zraven!« »Kar zgrabil te bom!« je rekel grdavš. »Počasi, počasi,« mu je segel v besedo fant. »Nikar se tako ne usti. Če si ti močan, sem jaz tudi, če ne še močnejši.« »To bova videla,« je rekel stari. »Če si močnejši od mene, ti bom prizanesel; daj, poskusiva se.« Nato je starec odvedel fanta po mnogih temnih hodnikih do neke kovačnice, vzel sekiro in z enim udarcem zabil nakovalo v zemljo. »To znam jaz še bolje,« je rekel fant in šel k drugemu nakovalu, starec pa se je postavil poleg njega, da bi bolje videl. Njegova dolga bela brada mu ja padala na prsi. In fant je pograbil sekiro, napravil z enim udarcem veliko režo v nakovalu ter stisnil starčevo brado vanjo. »Zdaj te pa imam,« je zmagoslavno rekel fant. »Zdaj si ti tisti, ki mora umreti.« Nato je pograbil železni drog in začel udrihati po starcu, dokler ni začel cviliti in ga prositi, naj neha, češ da mu bo dal velike zaklade. Fant je potegnil sekiro iz nakovala in ga izpustil. Stari ga je spet odvedel nazaj v grad in mu je pokazal v skriti kleti tri zaboje zlata. »Od tega zlata,« je dejal, »pripada en del siromakom, drugi del kralju, tretji tebi.« 

Vtem je ura odbila dvanajst, duh je izginil in fant je ostal sam v temi. »Nekako bom že prišel od tod,« je pomislil, se otipaval sem in tja in našel pot nazaj v izbo. Tam je ob svojem ognju zaspal. Drugo jutro je prišel kralj in rekel: »Zdaj si nazadnje menda spoznal, kaj je groza in strah?« »Ne,« je odgovoril oni. »Kaj je to? Moj mrtvi stric je bil tu in neki bradat človek je prišel, ki mi je pokazal veliko denarja, tega pa, kaj je strah in groza, mi ni povedal nihče.« Tedaj mu je kralj slovesno dejal: »Osvobodil si ta grad in dobil boš mojo hčer za ženo.« »To vse je zelo lepo,« je rekel mladenič, »toda jaz še vedno ne vem, kaj je strah, da bi se zgrozil.« Prinesli so zlato iz kleti in obhajali svatbo, toda mladi kralj, kakor je že imel rad svojo ženo in bil srečen z njo, je venomer govoril: »Ko bi vsaj vedel, kaj je strah! Ko bi se vsaj zgrozil.« Mladi ženi je to navsezadnje že presedalo, kar ji je njena sobarica priskočila na pomoč: »Pomagala bom; jaz ga že naučim, kaj je to groza.« In šla je k potoku, ki je tekel skozi vrt, ter prinesla poln škaf piškurjev. Ko je mladi kralj ponoči spal, je žena odgrnila odejo z njega ter zlila cel škaf mrzle vode s piškurji čezenj, tako da so ribice capljale po njem. In kralj se je prebudil in zavpil: »Uh, kako me je zgrozilo, kar zona me obliva, ljuba žena! Saj, saj, zdaj pa vem, kaj sta groza in strah!«

14,KING GRISLY-BEARD,"A great king of a land far away in the East had a daughter who was very
beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited, that none of the
princes who came to ask her in marriage was good enough for her, and she
only made sport of them.

Once upon a time the king held a great feast, and asked thither all
her suitors; and they all sat in a row, ranged according to their
rank--kings, and princes, and dukes, and earls, and counts, and barons,
and knights. Then the princess came in, and as she passed by them she
had something spiteful to say to every one. The first was too fat: ‘He’s
as round as a tub,’ said she. The next was too tall: ‘What a maypole!’
said she. The next was too short: ‘What a dumpling!’ said she. The
fourth was too pale, and she called him ‘Wallface.’ The fifth was too
red, so she called him ‘Coxcomb.’ The sixth was not straight enough;
so she said he was like a green stick, that had been laid to dry over
a baker’s oven. And thus she had some joke to crack upon every one: but
she laughed more than all at a good king who was there. ‘Look at
him,’ said she; ‘his beard is like an old mop; he shall be called
Grisly-beard.’ So the king got the nickname of Grisly-beard.

But the old king was very angry when he saw how his daughter behaved,
and how she ill-treated all his guests; and he vowed that, willing or
unwilling, she should marry the first man, be he prince or beggar, that
came to the door.

Two days after there came by a travelling fiddler, who began to play
under the window and beg alms; and when the king heard him, he said,
‘Let him come in.’ So they brought in a dirty-looking fellow; and when
he had sung before the king and the princess, he begged a boon. Then the
king said, ‘You have sung so well, that I will give you my daughter for
your wife.’ The princess begged and prayed; but the king said, ‘I have
sworn to give you to the first comer, and I will keep my word.’ So words
and tears were of no avail; the parson was sent for, and she was married
to the fiddler. When this was over the king said, ‘Now get ready to
go--you must not stay here--you must travel on with your husband.’

Then the fiddler went his way, and took her with him, and they soon came
to a great wood. ‘Pray,’ said she, ‘whose is this wood?’ ‘It belongs
to King Grisly-beard,’ answered he; ‘hadst thou taken him, all had been
thine.’ ‘Ah! unlucky wretch that I am!’ sighed she; ‘would that I had
married King Grisly-beard!’ Next they came to some fine meadows. ‘Whose
are these beautiful green meadows?’ said she. ‘They belong to King
Grisly-beard, hadst thou taken him, they had all been thine.’ ‘Ah!
unlucky wretch that I am!’ said she; ‘would that I had married King
Grisly-beard!’

Then they came to a great city. ‘Whose is this noble city?’ said she.
‘It belongs to King Grisly-beard; hadst thou taken him, it had all been
thine.’ ‘Ah! wretch that I am!’ sighed she; ‘why did I not marry King
Grisly-beard?’ ‘That is no business of mine,’ said the fiddler: ‘why
should you wish for another husband? Am not I good enough for you?’

At last they came to a small cottage. ‘What a paltry place!’ said she;
‘to whom does that little dirty hole belong?’ Then the fiddler said,
‘That is your and my house, where we are to live.’ ‘Where are your
servants?’ cried she. ‘What do we want with servants?’ said he; ‘you
must do for yourself whatever is to be done. Now make the fire, and put
on water and cook my supper, for I am very tired.’ But the princess knew
nothing of making fires and cooking, and the fiddler was forced to help
her. When they had eaten a very scanty meal they went to bed; but the
fiddler called her up very early in the morning to clean the house. Thus
they lived for two days: and when they had eaten up all there was in the
cottage, the man said, ‘Wife, we can’t go on thus, spending money and
earning nothing. You must learn to weave baskets.’ Then he went out and
cut willows, and brought them home, and she began to weave; but it made
her fingers very sore. ‘I see this work won’t do,’ said he: ‘try and
spin; perhaps you will do that better.’ So she sat down and tried to
spin; but the threads cut her tender fingers till the blood ran. ‘See
now,’ said the fiddler, ‘you are good for nothing; you can do no work:
what a bargain I have got! However, I’ll try and set up a trade in pots
and pans, and you shall stand in the market and sell them.’ ‘Alas!’
sighed she, ‘if any of my father’s court should pass by and see me
standing in the market, how they will laugh at me!’

But her husband did not care for that, and said she must work, if she
did not wish to die of hunger. At first the trade went well; for many
people, seeing such a beautiful woman, went to buy her wares, and paid
their money without thinking of taking away the goods. They lived on
this as long as it lasted; and then her husband bought a fresh lot of
ware, and she sat herself down with it in the corner of the market; but
a drunken soldier soon came by, and rode his horse against her stall,
and broke all her goods into a thousand pieces. Then she began to cry,
and knew not what to do. ‘Ah! what will become of me?’ said she; ‘what
will my husband say?’ So she ran home and told him all. ‘Who would
have thought you would have been so silly,’ said he, ‘as to put an
earthenware stall in the corner of the market, where everybody passes?
but let us have no more crying; I see you are not fit for this sort of
work, so I have been to the king’s palace, and asked if they did not
want a kitchen-maid; and they say they will take you, and there you will
have plenty to eat.’

Thus the princess became a kitchen-maid, and helped the cook to do all
the dirtiest work; but she was allowed to carry home some of the meat
that was left, and on this they lived.

She had not been there long before she heard that the king’s eldest son
was passing by, going to be married; and she went to one of the windows
and looked out. Everything was ready, and all the pomp and brightness of
the court was there. Then she bitterly grieved for the pride and folly
which had brought her so low. And the servants gave her some of the rich
meats, which she put into her basket to take home.

All on a sudden, as she was going out, in came the king’s son in golden
clothes; and when he saw a beautiful woman at the door, he took her
by the hand, and said she should be his partner in the dance; but she
trembled for fear, for she saw that it was King Grisly-beard, who was
making sport of her. However, he kept fast hold, and led her in; and the
cover of the basket came off, so that the meats in it fell about. Then
everybody laughed and jeered at her; and she was so abashed, that she
wished herself a thousand feet deep in the earth. She sprang to the
door to run away; but on the steps King Grisly-beard overtook her, and
brought her back and said, ‘Fear me not! I am the fiddler who has lived
with you in the hut. I brought you there because I really loved you. I
am also the soldier that overset your stall. I have done all this only
to cure you of your silly pride, and to show you the folly of your
ill-treatment of me. Now all is over: you have learnt wisdom, and it is
time to hold our marriage feast.’

Then the chamberlains came and brought her the most beautiful robes; and
her father and his whole court were there already, and welcomed her home
on her marriage. Joy was in every face and every heart. The feast was
grand; they danced and sang; all were merry; and I only wish that you
and I had been of the party.",1496,Kralj_Drozd,"Neki kralj je imel hčer, ki je bila tako neizmerno lepa, zraven pa tako ošabna in prevzetna, da ji noben snubač ni bil dovolj dober. Zavrnila je drugega za drugim, povrhu pa jih je še obsula s posmehom. Nekoč je kralj priredil veliko slavje in je povabil nanj vse ženitve željne moške od blizu in daleč. Vse jih je razvrstil po činu in stanu: najprej so prišli kralji, potlej vojvode, knezi, grofi, vitezi, nazadnje plemiški ljudje. Peljali so kraljično mimo vseh, ta pa je imela za vsakega kakšno pikro besedo. Nekdo je bil predebel: »Sod vinski,« je rekla. Drugi predolg: »Dolgokrak, omahljiv korak.« Tretji prekratek: »Kratek in rejen, štor zavaljen!« Četrti prebledi »Bledica Smrt!« Peti prerdeč: »Petelin na strehi!« Šesti ni bil dovolj raven: »Kriv ko dren, v zapečku posušen!« Res, prav vsem je imela kaj očitati, posebno pa se je znesla nad nekim dobrim kraljem, ki je stal čisto zgoraj in ki je imel malo krivo raščeno brado. »Ej,« je vzkliknila in se zasmejala, »ta ima pa brado kakor drozgov kljun.« In od tega časa dalje je dobil ime Drozgobrad ali kratko: kralj Drozd. Stari kralj pa, ki je videl, da njegova hči ne počne drugega, kakor da se posmehuje ljudem in zavrača vse snubače, ki so bili zbrani tam, se je silno razjezil. Prisegel je, da bo morala vzeti prvega berača, ki mu pride skozi vrata. 

Nekaj dni zatem se je oglasil pod oknom godec in pel pesmico, da bi si prislužil majhno miloščino. Ko ga je kralj zaslišal, je ukazal, naj ga pokličejo gor. Godec je vstopil v svoji umazani, razcapani obleki, zapel pred kraljem in njegovo hčerjo ter prosil za nagrado, ko je končal. »Tvoja pesem mi je tako ugajala, da ti hočem dati svojo hčer za ženo,« je rekel kralj. Kraljična se je zelo ustrašila, kralj pa je dejal: »Prisegel sem, da te bom dal prvemu beraču, in to prisego bom tudi izpolnil.« Vsi izgovori in prošnje niso nič pomagali, poklicali so župnika, da jo je pri priči poročil z godcem. Ko se je to zgodilo, je kralj rekel: »Ne spodobi se, da bi zdaj kot žena beračeva še dalje ostala pod mojo streho. Zato lahko odideš s svojim možem.« Berač jo je odvedel za roko in morala je peš hoditi z njim. Ko sta prišla do nekega velikega gozda, je vprašala: »Čigav je ta prelepi gozd?« »Njegov posestnik je kralj Drozd; da si ga vzela, bil bi tvoj.« »o, da, ubožica sem mlada, zavrgla kralja Drozgobrada!« Nato sta prišla na travnik, pa je spet vprašala: »Čigav je krasni travnik ta?« »Kralj Drozd v posesti ga ima, da si ga vzela, bil bi tvoj.« »O, da, ubožica sem mlada zavrgla kralja Drozgobrada!« Potem sta hodila po velikem mestu; spet je vprašala: »Čigavo pa je lepo mesto to?« »To mesto Drozdov grad zovo

da si ga vzela, tvoje bi bilo.« »o, da, ubožica sem mlada, zavrgla kralja Drozgobrada!« »Prav nič mi ne ugaja,« je rekel godec, »da si vedno želiš nekoga drugega za moža. Mar jaz nisem dovolj dober zate?« Nazadnje sta prišla do čisto majhne hišice. Rekla je: »o, majhna nizka hišica! Čigava je ta kočica?« »To je moja in tvoja hiša, kjer bova stanovala,« je odgovoril godec in vstopil. Tudi ona je vstopila, a se je morala pripogniti, da je prišla skozi vrata. »Kje so pa sluge?« je vprašala kraljična. »Kakšni sluge?« je odgovoril ubogi prosjak. »Sama boš morala storiti, kar boš hotela imeti storjeno. Daj, kar pr&ej zakuri in pristavi vodo, da mi skuhaš kosilo. Tako sem utrujen.« Kraljeva hči pa ni znala ne kuriti ne kuhati in prosjak je moral pomagati, da je za silo šlo. Ko sta použila svojo pičlo večerjico, sta legla spat. Zjutraj je prosjak že navsezgodaj dvignil svojo ženo na noge, ker je morala pospravljati. Nekaj dni sta živela tako, kakor je pač šlo. Pri tem pa sta porabila svojo zalogo. Zato je rekel mož: »Žena, ne gre več tako, da bi samo jedla in nič ne zaslužila. Košare boš pletla.« Šel je in narezal vrbovih šib ter jih prinesel domov. Začela je plesti, toda trdo vrbovje ji je do krvi ranilo občutljive roke. »Vidim, da ti ne gre,« je rekel mož, »rajši se loti presti, nemara znaš to bolje.« Sedla je h kolovratu in poskusila presti, toda trda nit se ji je kmalu zarezala v mehke prste, da se je pocedila kri iz njih. 

»Sama vidiš, da nisi za nobeno rabo, slabo sem jo skupil s teboj,« je rekel mož in dodal: »Poskusil bom začeti še trgovino z lonci in lončeno posodo. Sedela boš na trgu in ponujala blago na prodaj.« »Oh,« je pomislila, »če pridejo na trg ljudje iz dežele mojega očzia in me vidijo, da sedim tam in ponujam na prodaj, kako se mi bojo posmehovali!« Toda nič ni pomagalo, morala se je vdati, če ni hotela od lakote umreti. Prvikrat je šlo dobro. Ljudje so namreč radi kupovali pri ženi, ki je bila lepa, ter plačevali, kar je zahtevala. Res, marsikdo ji je dal denar, lonce pa kar pustil. Tako sta živela s pridobljenim, dokler je trajalo. Mož je spet nakupil zalogo nove posode. Sedla je s tem na vogal trga, razpostavila posodo okrog sebe in ponujala na prodaj. Tedaj pa je naenkrat pridirjal pijan huzar izza vogala in se zaletel naravnost v lonce, da se je vse razletelo na tisoč črepinj. Žena je zajokala in od strahu ni vedela, kaj bi. »Oh, kaj bo z menosj!«' je zastokala. »Kaj poreče moj mož!« Stekla je domov in mu povedala o svoji nesreči. »Kdo pa tudi seda z lončeno posodo na vogal!« je rekel mož. »Pusti zdaj solze, saj vidim, da nisi za nobeno pravo delo. Bil sem na gradu našega kralja in vprašal, ali bi potrebovali kakšno kuhinjsko deklo. Obljubili so mi, da te vzamejo. Za plačilo boš imela prosto hrano.« Tako je postala kraljeva hči kuhinjska dekla. Morala je pomagati kuharju in opravljati najbolj nečedno delo. V oba žepa si je pritrdila dva lončka. V njih je prinašala domov, kar je bilo ostankov. In s tem sta se hranila. Namerilo se je, da bi morali praznovati svatbo najstarejšega kraljevega sina. Ubogo ženo je gnala radovednost, da je šla, se postavila pred vrata v dvorano in hotela gledati. 

Ko so zagorele luči in so prihajali gostje, eden lepši od drugega, in je bilo vse polno krasote in sijaja, je s potrtim srcem pomislila na svojo usodo ter preklinjala svojo ošabnost in prevzetnost, ki sta jo ponižali in jo pahnili v tako revščino. Sluge so ji od slastnih jedil, ki so jih nosili v dvorano in spet odnašali in iz katerih se je dvigal prijeten duh k nji, vrgli tu pa tam kak grižljaj, ki ga je spravila v svoj lonček, da bi ga nesla domov. Naenkrat je vstopi], kraljevič. Oblečen je bil v svilo in žamet in okrog vratu je imel zlate verižice. In ko je zagledal lepo ženo pred vrati, jo je prijel za roko in hotel zaplesati z njo. Ona pa se je branila in se prestrašila. Opazila je namreč, da je to kralj Drozgobrad, ki se je nekoč potegoval zanjo in ga je z zasmehom zavrnila. Nič ni pomagalo, da se je upirala, kraljevič jo je potegnil v dvorano. Tedaj pa se ji je utrgal trak, s katerim sta bila privezana žepa, in lončka sta padla na tla, da se je juha z jedili razlila po tleh. In ko so ljudje to videli, je nastal splošen krohot in porogljiv smeh, njo pa je bilo tako sram, da bi bila najrajši tisoč klafter pod zemljo. Skočila je skozi vrata in hotela pobegniti, na stopnicah pa jo je ujel neki moški in jo privedel nazaj; in ko se je ozrla vanj, je bil to spet kralj Drozgobrad. Prijazno ji je dejal: »Nič se ne boj, jaz in tisti godec, ki je stanoval s teboj v borni hišici, sva eno. Zaradi tebe sem se tako prenaredil, in tisti huzar, ki ti je razbil vse lonce, sem bil tudi jaz. To vse se je zgodilo, da bi se upognila tvoja prevzetnost in bi bil kaznovan tvoj napuh, s katerim si me zasramovala.« Tedaj se je žena bridko razjokala in rekla: »Veliko krivico sem storila in nisem vredna, da bi ti bila žena.« 

On pa ji je rekel: »Potolaži se, hudi dnevi so pri kraju, zdaj bova praznovala svojo svatbo.« In so prišle spletične in jo oblekle v najkrasnejša oblačila. Prišel je tudi oče in veš dvor in želeli so ji srečo s kraljem Drozgobradom. In pravo veselje se je šele zdaj začelo.
